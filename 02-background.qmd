The human mouth, or oral cavity, contains many different types of surfaces
available for bacteria to attach and grow. A similar thing can be said for
the mouths of other mammals, but that's not the focus here.
These surfaces are both hard (teeth) and soft (mucosa, tongue, gingiva), and are exposed to
the external environment. The conditions within the oral cavity can also vary considerably,
causing a unique range of habitats for a wide variety of microbes.
In fact, the oral biome contains bacteria from over 600 different
species, some of which still haven't been named yet<!--cite-->.
There are so many bacteria in our mouth that it's actually hard to determine
how many are there at any given time, but most estimates are in the
billions. The oral biome is complex. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely,
mind-bogglingly complex it is. I mean, you may think quantum physics is complicated,
but that's just peanuts to the oral biome [@adamsHitchhikersGuide2002, p.66].
As such, this chapter reflects the knowledge at the time of writing, and no
warranty is given for the inevitable new developments that will change what we now
believe to be true.<!-- rephrase -->

## Biofilms

<!-- what is it? -->
The concept of biofilms represents a recent paradigm shift in microbiology
[@costertonBacterialBiofilmsNature1987; @costertonMicrobialBiofilms1995].
Before this, researchers believed that you could isolate bacteria of
interest and learn about its growth, metabolism, etc. They assumed
bacteria would behave the same way as a free-floating organism in a
lab test tube as it would in a real-world environment (such as the human mouth).
More recently researchers have discovered that the
behaviour of bacteria differs when they are part of a larger community,
compared to when they are grown in isolation.
One such baterial community is a biofilm. Biofilms consist of multi-species
communities of bacteria enclosed in an extracellular matrix of their
own creation. The ability to produce this matrix gives the bacteria an
adaptive advantage. It equips them with resistance to both antimicrobials
(such as antibiotic medication) and
immune responses from the host that would normally affect their
ability to survive [@marshDentalPlaque2005, @marshPhysiologicalApproaches1997].
The viscoelastic nature of the biofilm provides some protection against mechanical
destruction and dislodgement [@petersonViscoelasticityBiofilms2015].
<!--rephrase-->It also allows them to acquire nutrients from outside the biofilm,
as well as generate and distribute nutrients within the biofilm to
different species of bacteria [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].

### Dental plaque

Dental calculus forms from a specific oral biofilm known as dental plaque.
After we clean our teeth, our saliva coats the surface of our teeth (enamel)
with a layer of proteins known as the dental pellicle
(or acquired enamel pellicle).
The pellicle is a film that protects our teeth from both mechanical wear and
chemical decay, but in doing so, provides a viable surface for microorganisms
to attach, initiating the formation of a biofilm.

![A simplified overview of biofilm formation. Still under construction.](./figures/biofilm_formation.png){#fig-biofilm-form fig-alt="Overview of biofilm formation progressing through stages, including ..."}

<!-- pellicle and initial physicochemical attachment -->
Biofilm formation goes through several, often abitrarily defined, stages of growth.
They are arbitrary because they are defined by the researchers who study them,
but also necessary as a foundation to explain the growth of a biofilm.
Rather than thinking about the stages as occurring sequentially, you should think of
them as occurring concurrently across different areas of the tooth surface. Biofilm
formation is a very dynamic process, and is often over-simplified in visualisations
(not unlike @fig-biofilm-form).
The pellicle contains proteins (known as adhesins) that allow certain bacteria to
attach, so when the pellicle covers the tooth surface it becomes a surface
for bacterial attachment. The first bacteria to attach are known as early coloniser
bacteria (or pioneer colonisers), and
include *Streptococcus* species (spp.), *Actinomyces* spp., and *Haemophilus* spp
[@zijngeBiofilmArchitecture2010, @uzelMicrobialShifts2011].
The initial attachment occurs when the random movement of bacteria and the flow
of saliva brings them close enough to the pellicle to attach. Some bacteria have
a limited ability to move if they have long hair-like structures known as
flagella.
As bacteria approach the pellicle-coated surface of a tooth, there are both
attractive and repulsive forces at work. This is because both the bacteria and
pellicle proteins have a negative charge, like putting together the wrong ends
of two magnets. Depending on the distance from the bacteria to the surface, there
will be attractive (van der Waals) or repulsive (electrostatic energy) forces,
leading to a game of 'will-they-won't-they'
between the bacteria and pellicle. If the bacteria come too close to the surface,
the initial attraction (primary maximum) will most likely be overcome by the
repulsion (primary maximum). Bacteria are more likely to attach when they encounter
attractive forces at a further distance (secondary minimum).
The early attractive forces are weak, and attachment is initially reversible,
as bacteria can become detached by salivary flow or shearing action by the tongue
[@marshDentalPlaque2016].

These receptors are often carbohydrates formed by
the host, meaning us. Early colonisers are also able to attach to proteins and
enzymes present in saliva, as well as the surface of other early colonisers
[@nikitkovaStarchBiofilms2013, @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].

While some bacteria specialise in attaching to surfaces, not all of them have this
ability. However, once the specialists have attached, they allow other bacteria
(secondary colonisers) to attach to them (coadhesion). This can occur on a large scale,
allowing the number
and types of bacteria on the tooth surface to grow, due to the ability of different
species to attach to each other (coaggregation)
[@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @marshDentalPlaque2006]. Coaggregation is an
important part in oral biofilm formation, and most oral taxa have the ability
to coaggregate with distinct species through cell-cell interactions
[@kolenbranderOralMultispecies2010; @palmerInterbacterialAdhesion2017].

<!-- direct (non-reversible) attachment to surface -->
Bacteria may also attach directly to the surface of the pellicle with hair-like <!-- yes, hair-like again... -->
structures (fimbriae) that are present on the surface of some bacteria. These
hair-like structures attach to matching receptors that
are present in the pellicle.

Firm attachment occurs when bacteria are more directly attached to the surface,
rather than weak long-distance (physicochemical) forces. Some bacteria have
components on their surface that allow them to attach directly to complementary
components on the dental pellicle (adhesin-receptor interactions). These
attachments are very specific because only certain bacteria have the right
molecules on their surface. These are mainly *Streptococcus* spp. After
the direct attachment has occurred, coadhesion allows bacteria of other
types to attach to the already attached bacteria. For example, *S. gordonii*
can attach to both the pellicle and *A. naeslundii*. And there are many more
examples of these bacteria-host and bacteria-bacteria interactions that
are involved in the growth of a biofilm. Not all attachments involve proteins.
They can also involve carbohydrates, enzymes, and various appendages on the
surface of the bacteria, although these appendages often consist of proteins
in their structure (for example pili and fimbriae, which have already
been mentioned).

<!-- bacterial multiplication of early colonisers-->

Fundamental changes in the genes of bacteria can occur upon attachment to the
dental pellicle, inducing a biofilm phenotype in many bacteria that favours
coaggregation between distinct species<!-- cite-->.

<!-- metabolism of early colonisers and modification of local environment-->

<!-- biofilm and extracellular matrix formation -->
As the biofilm formed by early colonisers grows through continued multiplication and
coadhesion/coaggregation, the proportion of streptococci
gradually decreases while
there is an increase of *Actinomyces* spp. and *Fusobacterium nucleatum*.
*F. nucleatum* is a bacterium also known as the 'bridging species', as it's
believed to play an important part in linking together early and late coloniser
species---including *Prevotella* spp., *S. gordonii*, and *Porphyromonas gingivalis*---
which would not otherwise be able to coaggregate
[@kolenbranderAdhereToday1993; @kolenbranderOralMultispecies2010].

Once there is a sufficient amount and diversity of bacteria adhering to a surface,
the communities can alter the local environment for more favourable conditions.
an extracellular matrix will be formed from the production of polymers by certain
bacterial species [@marshMicrobiologyDental2010].
Microenvironmental changes can allow species to survive in otherwise unfavourable
environments. An example is the survival of obligate anaerobes in an environment
which is largely aerobic (oxygen is continuously introduced to the oral cavity
through breathing). This is made possible by bacteria with the ability to
consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide[@marshDentalPlaque2005]. In fact, dental plaque
predominantly consists of obligate and facultative anaerobes<!-- Marsh -->.
A pH balance may be maintained by species that are able to consume acidic metabolic
products, produced by other species, and convert them to weaker acids.
*Veillonella* spp. especially [@marshDentalPlaque2005].
Further changes in members of the biofilm community can also occur through
horizontal gene transfer.
Working as a community to increase survivability in the harsh and dynamic
environment of the oral cavity, with rapid changes in pH, oxygen, nutrient
availability, etc. Metabolic products of some bacteria are used by others
as nutrients. Hydrogen peroxide produced by streptococci can be used by
... and lactate formed by carbohydrate fermentation ....

Bacteria can produce compounds that inhibit the growth of other bacteria.
Production of acids can reduce the pH of biofilms and inhibit pH sensitive
bacteria. Other bacteria can produce compounds that are toxic to yet other
bacteria (e.g. $H_2O_2$ and bacteriocins).

Competition between bacteria still exists within the biofilm. The metabolic
by-products produced by some bacteria may allow them to gain an advantage
over others. The aforementioned acid-production by some bacteria can cause
unfavourable conditions for species that prefer more neutral pH environments,
particularly in the absence of secondary feeders that would normally neutralise
these compounds. A more direct example of bacterial competition is the ability
of bacteria to produce substances that are toxic to other bacteria. These are
often proteins or peptides termed bacteriocins, and can either inhibit or even
kill bacteria [@grahamEnterococcusFaecalis2017; @dawBacteriocinsNature1996].
Oral streptococci produce toxins that give them a competitive advantage over
other species ... Resistance and even use of these as a nutrient allow
*Veillonella* spp. to accumulate in the biofilm ...
[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018].
<!-- bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide, organic acids and low pH, nutrient competition -->

<!--Biofilm maturation

Detachment of bacteria and colonisation of other areas of a surface is an important part of
biofilm maturation.-->
Perhaps ironically, an important part of the maturation of a biofilm is detachment of
bacteria from the biofilm.

### Dental calculus

<!-- biofilm mineralisation -->
<!-- Dental calculus is mineralised plaque. At what point does plaque become calculus? Is there a critical threshold? Is it gradual?-->
<!-- need to be more consistent with terminology of mineral, salt, ions, etc. -->
The exact mechanism of biomineralisation within dental plaque is not fully
understood. As such, the processes outlined in this particular section are
inevitably subject to change with scientific advancements, and I take no
responsibility for the accuracy of this section if you are reading this in the
future (or reading it my present but you are from the future - all depending on
where you land on the mechanisms and feasibility time-travel).

<!-- initial mineralisation -->
Initial mineralisation of dental plaque is a chemical process in which equilibrium
of minerals in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid tips towards saturation with
regard to calcium and phosphate, causing an increase of precipitation relative to
dissolution. This means, that when the concentration
of ions surpassess a critical threshold to overcome dissolution, salts will deposit
on the plaque instead of dissolving in the saliva. Plaque absorbs the minerals and,
once the concentration of minerals reaches a critical threshold (supersaturation),
nucleation is triggered within the plaque matrix and initiates crystal growth.
This may or may not involve spontaneous
(or homogenous) nucleation, as it's unclear whether mineral concentrations are
sufficient to cause spontaneous nucleation, or whether other biochemical
processes act as a catalyst [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013]. That it's a chemical
process can be shown by the ability to produce calculus deposits in germ-free
rats [@theiladeGermfreeCalculus1964; @glasGermfreeCalculus1962]. It's unclear
how the germ-free calculus compares to conventional calculus, and, to my
knowledge there have only been studies done on rats.
Just because calculus growth can be induced in sterile conditions, doesn't
mean bacteria are non-essential to the process.
Bacteria are inevitably part of the scaffolding of dental calculus in humans,
since, as I mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, our mouths are full
of bacteria. Mineralisation does seem to start in the biofilm matrix between
microorganisms, but they are eventually mineralised along with the biofilm matrix
[@friskoppUltrastructureNondecalcified1983].
There are pockets of living bacteria within dental calculus. These pockets and
the layer of plaque that covers the surface of dental calculus are likely what
cause the correlation between calculus presence and periodontal disease
[@tanBacterialViability2004].
While the process can be explained by chemistry, the conditions leading up to
and surrounding the process are both chemical and biological in nature,
and certainly involve bacteria.

The essentials for calculus formation are therefore a source of minerals, and
particular conditions encouraging crystal formation and growth.

<!-- factors affecting saturation of minerals - pH, saliva flow rates, saliva mineral content -->

Two critical aspects of plaque mineralisation are
therefore a ... source of the calcium and phosphate
salts, and crystal nucleation/growth promoters (and of course an absence of inhibitors).
The source of minerals for mineralisation of supragingival plaque is saliva,
while the source of minerals subgingival plaque is gingival crevicular fluid.
Both fluids are a rich source of calcium and phosphate (and other) minerals
[@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
<!-- mineral availability in saliva -->
The main mineral components of calculus are crystals containing various combinations
of calcium and phosphate ions. Other salts are also present, but the bulk of the
crystals are made up of calcium and phosphate. The main source of minerals in the
oral cavity is saliva, which enters the mouth through salivary glands. The three
main paired glands are the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular glands, located
by the cheeks, under the tongue, and under the lower jaw bone, respectively. The
locations of the glands contribute to the pattern of dental calculus deposits
within the mouth, with commonly occur on buccal portion of maxillary (upper) molars
and lingual portion of mandibular (lower) incisors
[@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].
Saliva contains sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), chlorine (Cl),
bicarbonate (buffer), and inorganic phosphate (Pi)
[@dawesEffectsDietSalivary1970; @doddsHealthBenefits2005].

Salivary pH also affects saturation
of salts, which in turn is influenced by salivary flow rates. Increased flow rate
of saliva will increase salivary pH, which reduces dissolution and increases
precipitation of calcium and phosphate. This is an important mechanism that protects
our teeth against demineralisation of the enamel caused by caries. Protection is
provided by the exchange of calcium and phosphate from saliva to enamel
[@dahlenMicrobiologicalStudy2010].
Saliva further acts
as a buffer for the oral cavity, reducing
the impact of short-term drops in pH caused by metabolic byproducts of acid-producing
bacteria [@doddsHealthBenefits2005; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002]. Higher rates of salivary
flow are also likely to contribute to an increase in calcium and phosphate secretion
in addition to pH, all contributing to an environment favouring plaque mineralisation.
Metabolic byproducts produced by bacteria can also affect local pH, both pushing towards
alkaline conditions as well as acidic. A major cause of acidic pH is metabolism
of overabundant dietary sugars, especially the metabolic activity of
*Streptococcus mutans*, known to be one of the main culprits behind dental caries
[@bowenOralBiofilms2018; @extercateAAA2010].

Conversely, alkaline conditions can
be induced by metabolism of various products that can either be directly or
indirectly linked to diet. One such product is urea. Urea is present in saliva,
and its concentration depends on multiple factors, including diet<!-- citation-->.
Hydrolysis of urea produces ...<!-- ammonia? --> and causes a rise in pH.
Bacteria possess the ability to...
[@wongCalciumPhosphate2002; @sissonsPHResponseUrea1994].

<!-- The salivary minerals play an important role in remineralisation of enamel.... -->
<!-- promoters and inhibitors of mineralisation -->
<!-- bacterial mineralisation -->
There are also a number of inhibitors and promoters of mineralisation present in
the oral cavity, originating both from saliva and bacteria. Two substances known
to promote plaque mineralisation through hydroxyapatite formation and deposition,
calcium-phospholipid-phosphate complexes (CPLX), are present in bacteria. The
species that has received the most attention is *Corynebacterium matruchotii*
(formerly *Bacterionema matruchotii*), which accumulates
calcium within its cell structure
[@takazoeCalciumHydroxyapatite1970; @enneverIntracellularCalcification1960 in @enneverMicrobiologicCalcification1967; @boyan-salyersRelationshipProteolipids1980].
Biomineralisation is not a feature unique to *Corynebacterium matruchotii*.
Even species associated with caries may induce calcification under the right conditions
and after cell death [@moorerCalcificationCariogenic1993; @sidawayMicrobiologicalStudy1978a].

<!-- nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors -->
[@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; ]

It's likely that multiple biomineralisation events occur under various conditions,
resulting in a heterogenous calculus composition with crystals of various stages
of growth [@friskoppComparativeScanning1980; @friskoppUltrastructureNondecalcified1983].
The differing susceptibility of bacteria to calcification is also a contributor
the heterogenous composition.

<!-- Need an analogy. 
	minerals are the ingredients, promoters are the ..., and local environment is the ... --->

A complex interaction between conditions in the local environment, availability
of minerals, the equilibrium between precipitation and dissolution, balance
between nucleation promoters and inhibitors. 

An intricate inter-connected system which maintains a balance, and when changes
happen to one or more parts of the system, can result in disease. Or calculus.

### Saliva

Saliva is hugely important to the ‘normal’ functioning of the oral biome,
and as such has a large role in the formation of dental calculus. Saliva
is a biofilm(?) comprised of around 99% water; however, the remaining 1%
consists of proteins, enzymes, …., which provides it with a wide variety of
functions (cite). -->

## Oral biofilm models

<!-- what is it -->
Biofilm models are a way to of studying the growth and development of
biofilms by creating models that replicate the conditions and complexity
(to some extent) of biofilms in a lab. Models allow researchers to conduct
various experiments on biofilms to test the efficacy of treatments on the
growth and pathogenicity of biofilms.

Biofilm models can differ widely in their complexity. The simplest models
generally involve multiwell plates (e.g., 6-, 24-, and 98-well plates) with
a substratum (usually glass cover-slips or hydroxyapatite discs) placed at
the bottom of the well. An inoculate, either single (pure culture) or multiple
select species (defined consortium), or organisms occuring naturally within a
system (microcosm). Examples of microcosms used for oral biofilm models are
plaque and saliva.<!-- rephrase -->
The inoculate is added to the wells to initiate biofilm formation on the
substrata. Medium
containing salivary components may be added for extended experiments (where donated
saliva may be too limited).
Similar models suspend the substrata from a lid
to promote active attachment of bacteria to the substrata [@extercateAAA2010],
which also allows samples to be periodically transferred between solutions/media
if necessary.

Another level of model complexity can be added by adjusting the rate at which nutrients
are dispersed in the system and the overall nutrient supply.
Nutrient distribtion can be continuous, semi-continuous, or batch cultures, with the latter
providing a finite amount of nutrients in a closed system, like an agar plate, versus
a continuous supply of nutrients dispersed through the system from a reservoir that can
be replenished (with semi-continuous landing somewhere in between).

Finally, the artificial mouth models provide control over a large number of
parameters using multiple chambers dedicated to providing complete control
over the flow of
treatment and/or nutrient conditions, as well as the environmental conditions
such as pH, temperature, and gas phase, as well as access to real-time measurements
[@sissonsArtificialPlaque1997].

The complexity of a model can either be introduced
as a selective inoculation (pure culture, defined consortium, microcosm)
or as complexity in reproducing the oral environment.

Benefits of pure cultures and defined consortia are reproducibility between
experiments and more control over physiological and factors and making it easier
to take various measurements. Microcosms have the benefit of more closely
mimicking the complexity of the organisms' natural environment [@mcbainBiofilmModels2009].
However, even microcosms can be limited in their ability to recreate the complexity and
diversity of the oral microbiome [@tianUsingDGGE2010].

Models developed for studying oral biofilms include, in somewhat increasing complexity,
the ACTA active attachment (AAA) model [@extercateAAA2010], Calgary biofilm device
[@ceriCalgaryBiofilm1999], modified Robbins device (MRD) [@honraetModifiedRobbins2006],
constant depth film-fermenter (CDFF) [@petersConstantDepth1988],
and the multistation artificial mouth (MAM) [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]
representing the upper echelon of complexity.

The duration of biofilm growth depends on the scope of the study. Some are
used to explore initial biofilm formation and prevention and may last up
from a few hours to 48 hours [@extercateAAA2010; dibdinDiffusionSugars1981],
while experiments looking at maturation and calcification of biofilms can last
up to six weeks
[@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002; @filocheFluorescenceAssay2007].
Alternatives to *in vitro* models are *in situ* models which usually involve
growing plaque on a removable surface inside a the mouth of a willing participant.
These models add a level of realism, as they are grown inside an actual oral
cavity, and can reflect biogeographical differences in biofilm composition caused
by differing conditions across the oral cavity. They also come with additional difficulties
and reduced control over experimental parameters [@marshRoleMicrobiology1995; @zeroSituCaries1995].
