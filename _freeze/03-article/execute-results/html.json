What makes dental calculus so well suited\nfor this task is that it forms on our teeth, and is therefore in direct\ncontact with what we eat. It also hardens to form a strong, solid material\nthat can survive for long periods of time and preserve what's inside.\nWhile we have been able to extract a lot of information from archaeological \ndental calculus, there are still many things we don't know about the context\nof this information.\nFor example, we have no way to confirm exactly what people were eating,\nwe can only infer this from what we see; but, there are many factors that\ninfluence what actually ends up in dental calculus, and it's not all food.\n\nTo address some of these issues, we have grow our own\ndental calculus in a lab under controlled conditions. This will allow\nus to conduct experiments to test what we see and how it relates to the\ninterpretations we make.\nIn this study, we examine our lab-grown dental calculus to make sure it\nlooks and behaves like naturally-occurring dental calculus, specifically\nthe bacterial and mineral content. We found some differences in bacterial\ncontent, which is not uncommon for lab-grown dental plaque and calculus.\nOverall, though, the lab-grown model has the makeup of\nan oral microbiome, and the mineral content is very similar to natural\ndental calculus.\n\nWe recommend using lab-grown models to mitigate some of the\nissues we encounter when using archaeological dental\ncalculus to reconstruct past diets, while we also acknowledge that the model\nis not a replacement for research on natural calculus, both\narchaeological and modern.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline - what is ancient dental calculus and why is it interesting?-->\n\nDental calculus is becoming an increasingly popular substance for exploring health and\ndiet in past populations [@warinnerNewEra2015].\nDuring life, dental plaque undergoes periodic mineralisation, trapping biomolecules and\nmicrofossils that are embedded within the dental plaque biofilm in the newly-formed\ndental calculus. This process\nis repeated as new plaque is deposited and subsequently mineralises, resulting in\na layered structure representing a temporal record of biofilm growth and development\n[@warinnerPathogensHost2014].\nThe calculus serves as a protective casing for the entrapped biomolecules and\nmicrofossils, preserving\nthem for thousands of years after death and burial [@yatesOralMicrobiome2021].\nStudies using archaeological dental calculus span a wide\nrange of topics in different regions and time periods. These include characterisation\nof the oral microbiome and its evolution in past populations\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @kazarinaPostmedievalMicrobial2021; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021],\nas well as extraction of microbotanical remains\n[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranules2009;@mickleburghNewInsights2012; @maHumanDiet2022]\nand other residues to infer dietary patterns and nicotine use\n[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018; @eerkensDentalCalculus2018; @bartholdyMultiproxyAnalysis2023; @velskoDentalCalculus2017].\n<!-- expand arch applications of DC -->\n<!-- what are current limitations of DC? hint at why we need this study -->\nDental calculus has already provided a unique and valuable insight into the past,\nbut the exact mechanism of the incorporation, retention, and preservation of\nmicrofossils and biomolecules exogenous to the microbial biofilm is largely unknown;\neven the process of plaque mineralisation\nis not fully understood [@omelonReviewPhosphate2013; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nThis means that there may be hidden biases affecting our\ninterpretations of dietary/activity patterns extrapolated from ancient dental calculus.\nThese biases have been explored archaeologically\n[@fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2022; @trompEDTACalculus2017] as well as in\ncontemporary humans [@leonardPlantMicroremains2015] and non-human primates\n[@powerChimpCalculus2015], but not experimentally.\n<!-- why are biofilm models valuable? maybe move to biofilm paragraph -->\n\n<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->\n<!-- How does calculus form? -->\nDental plaque is an oral biofilm and is part of the normal state of the oral\ncavity. However, when left unchecked, plaque can lead to infections, such as\ndental caries and periodontitis, and/or mineralisation [@marshDentalPlaque2006].\nThe dental plaque biofilm grows in a well-characterized manner before mineralisation,\nin a process that repeats regularly to build up dental calculus.\nShortly after teeth are cleaned (whether mechanically or otherwise), salivary\ncomponents adsorb to the crown or root and form the acquired dental pellicle.\nThe pellicle provides a viable surface for bacteria to attach, especially\nearly-coloniser species within the genera *Streptococcus* and *Actinomyces*\n[@marshDentalPlaque2006]. Once\nthe tooth surface has been populated by specialists in surface-attachment, other\nspecies of bacteria can attach to the adherent cells, increasing the biofilm density\nand diversity. The bacterial species secrete polysaccharides, proteins, lipids,\nand nucleic acids, into their immediate environment to form a matrix that provides\nstructural support, nutrition, and allows for environmental niche partitioning\n[@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016].\n<!-- composition of plaque and DC -->\n\nBiofilms can become susceptible to\ncalcification under certain microenvironmental conditions, including an increased\nconcentration of salts and a decrease in statherin\nand proline-rich proteins in saliva, rises in local plaque pH, and increased\nhydrolysis of urea [@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002].\nThese conditions can cause increased precipitation and decreased dissolution of\ncalcium phosphate salts within saliva and the plaque biofilm.\nThe resulting supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts is the main\ndriver of biofilm mineralisation [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nThe primary minerals in dental calculus are hydroxyapatite,\noctacalcium phosphate, whitlockite, and brushite. During initial\nmineralisation the main mineral component is brushite, which shifts to hydroxyapatite\nin more\nmature dental calculus [@jinSupragingivalCalculus2002; @hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008].\nThe exact elemental composition of dental calculus varies among individuals due to\nvarious factors, including diet [@hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008; @jiFluorideMagnesium2000].\n\nDental plaque can also be grown *in vitro*, and these oral biofilm models are\ncommonly used in dental research to assess the efficacy\nof certain treatments on dental pathogens [@filochePlaqueMicrocosm2007; @extercateAAA2010]\nwithout the ethical issues of inducing plaque accumulation in study participants\nand the complexity of access and sampling in humans or animals.\nOral biofilm models are often short-term models grown over a few days, but\nlonger term models also exist (up to six weeks) which are used to develop mature plaque or\ndental calculus\n[@middletonVitroCalculus1965; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; @wongCalciumPhosphate2002; @velskoConsistentReproducible2018]. \n<!-- oral biofilm models. Why are they valuable and what are limitations of current models? -->\n<!-- limitations of current models -->\nA well-known limitation of biofilm models is the difficulty in capturing the\ndiversity and complexity of bacterial communities and metabolic dependencies,\nmicro-environments, nutrient availability, and host immune-responses in the natural\noral biome\n[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013; @velskoConsistentReproducible2018; @velskoCytokineResponse2017].\nThese limitations can be overcome by complex experimental setups, but at the cost\nof lower throughput and increased requirements for laboratory facilities.\n\nDespite the limitations, oral biofilm models have many benefits over *in situ* research.\nThere are many variables involved in dental calculus formation, such as intra-\nand inter-individual variation in salivary flow, oral pH,\nand amylase activity, which can be hard to tease apart *in situ*.\nOral biofilm models provide a controlled environment to explore the effect of\nselected variables on the growth of calculus and the retention of dietary\ncomponents in the biofilm, as well as a means to identify\nhow the methods used in archaeology may inadvertently bias the interpretations.\nThis type of research has, so far, been limited, but has the potential to greatly benefit\narchaeological research on past diet [@radiniDirtyTeeth2022].\n\n<!-- What did we do and why?\nclearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study \nJustify the methods we chose and how they relate to the questions we're asking about\nthe model and what questions we want to ask with the model-->\n\n<!-- condense last two paragraphs to single -->\n\nWe present an oral biofilm model that can serve as a viable proxy for dental\ncalculus for archaeology-oriented research questions.\nIt is a multispecies biofilm using whole saliva as the inoculate, with a simple\nmultiwell plate setup that is accessible even to smaller lab budgets and those\nwith limited facilities for microbiology work.\nHere, we used next-generation sequencing and metagenomic classification\nto characterise the bacterial composition of our model dental calculus and compare\nit to oral reference samples, including saliva, buccal mucosa, plaque, and modern human\ndental calculus. This was done to ensure that the model microbiome is predominantly\noral and not overgrown by environmental contaminants.\nWe then determined the mineral composition of the model dental calculus using Fourier\ntransform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to verify the presence of calculus-specific\nmineral phases and functional groups, and perform a qualitative comparison with\nmodern and archaeological reference calculus. \nOverall the model calculus is chemically similar to natural calculus, and has\na predominantly oral microbiome.\nThe microbial diversity and richness within the model samples were lower than\noral reference samples, suggesting that the model samples do not contain identical\nspecies composition and abundances as the natural samples.\nThe mineral composition closely resembles modern and archaeological reference\ncalculus, predominantly comprised of carbonate hydroxyapatite with a similar level of\ncrystallinity and order.\nAs such, the model dental calculus presented here is a viable proxy to natural\ndental calculus and can be used to explore many of the currently unexplained\nprocesses we see in the archaeological material, when working within the\nlimitations of an oral biofilm model.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n\nOur biofilm setup consists of whole saliva as the inoculate to approximate\nnatural microbial communities within the human oral cavity, and a 24-well plate\nto generate multiple replicated conditions in a single experimental run\n(see @fig-met-protocol for an overview of the protocol).\nThe biofilm\nis grown for 25 days to allow time for growth of larger deposits and mineralisation.\nRaw potato and wheat starch solutions were added during the biofilm growth to\nexplore the biases involved in their incorporation and extraction from dental\ncalculus. These results are presented in a separate article [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].\n\n![Overview of the protocol for biofilm growth. The samples for metagenomic analysis were grown in a separate experimental plate than the FTIR samples under the same experimental conditions. Biofilm (B) and calculus (C) samples were used for FTIR spectroscopy, and saliva (S), artificial saliva (M), and calculus samples were used for metagenomic analysis.](figures/Exp_protocol.png){#fig-met-protocol}\n\nTo determine the composition of microbial communities, we sampled the medium\nfrom the biofilm wells over the course of the experiment. We sequenced the DNA\nto identify species that are present in the model, and assess whether these mimic\nnatural oral communities. During a separate experimental run, under the same\nconditions, we directly sampled the biofilms on multiple days and determined the\nmineral composition using FTIR, and compared the spectra to those of natural\ndental calculus, both modern and archaeological. Samples were taken from both\ncontrols and starch treatments, but differences between these samples were not\nexplored in this study.\n\n### Biofilm growth\n\n<!-- Create table for all samples and indicate which samples underwent DNA, FTIR, etc. -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe employ a multispecies oral biofilm model following a modified\nprotocol from Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991] and\nShellis [-@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978]. The setup comprises a polypropylene\n24 deepwell PCR plate (KingFisher 97003510) with a lid containing 24 pegs (substrata),\nwhich are autoclaved at 120$^{\\circ}$C, 1 bar overpressure, for 20 mins.\n\nThe artificial saliva (hereafter referred to as medium) is a modified version of\nthe basal medium mucin (BMM)\ndescribed by Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\nIt is a complex medium containing 2.5 g/l partially purified mucin from porcine\nstomach (Type III, Sigma M1778),\n5 g/l trypticase peptone (Roth 2363.1), 10 g/l proteose peptone (Oxoid LP0085),\n5 g/l yeast extract (BD 211921), 2.5 g/l KCl, 0.35 g/l NaCl, 1.8 mmol/l CaCl~2~,\n5.2 mmol/l Na~2~HPO~4~ [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991], 6.4 mmol/l NaHCO~3~\n[@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978], 2.5 mg/l haemin. This is subsequently\nadjusted to pH 7 with NaOH pellets and stirring, autoclaved (15 min, 120$^{\\circ}$C,\n1 bar overpressure), and supplemented with 5.8 \\(mu\\)mol/l menadione, 5 mmol/l urea,\nand 1 mmol/l arginine [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\n\nFresh whole saliva (WS) for inoculation was provided by a 31-year-old male donor\nwith no history of caries, who abstained from oral hygiene for 24 hours, and no\nfood was consumed two hours prior to donation. No antibiotics were taken up to six\nmonths prior to donation.\nSaliva was stimulated by chewing on parafilm, then filtered through a bleach-sterilised\nnylon cloth to remove particulates.\nSubstrata were inoculated with 1 ml/well of a two-fold dilution of WS in sterilised\n20% glycerine for four hours at 36$^{\\circ}$C, to allow attachment of the\nsalivary pellicle and plaque-forming bacteria. After initial inoculation, the\nsubstrata were transferred to a new plate containing 1 ml/well medium and incubated\nat 36$^{\\circ}$C, with gentle motion at 30 rpm. The inoculation process was repeated\non days 3 and 5 by transferring the samples to a new plate with inoculate.\nMedium was partially refreshed once per day, by topping up the wells to the original\nvolume with more medium, and fully refreshed every three days,\nthroughout the experiment, by transferring the substrata to a new plate containing\nmedium. To feed the bacteria, the substrata were transferred to a new plate, containing\n5% (w/v) sucrose, for six minutes twice daily, except on inoculation days\n(days 0, 3, and 5), where the samples only received one sucrose treatment after\ninoculation.\n\nOn day 9, starch treatments were introduced, replacing sucrose treatments (except\nfor control sample). As with the sucrose treatments, starch treatments occurred\ntwice per day for six minutes, and involved transferring the substrata to a\nnew plate containing a 0.25% (w/v) starch from potato (Roth 9441.1) solution, a\n0.25% (w/v) starch from wheat (Sigma S5127) solution, and a 0.5% (w/v) mixture of\nequal concentrations (w/v) wheat and potato.\nAll starch solutions were created in a 5%\n(w/v) sucrose solution. Before transferring biofilm samples to the starch treatments,\nthe starch plates were agitated to keep the starches in suspension in the solutions,\nand during treatments, the rpm was increased to 60.\nThe purpose of starch treatments was to explore the incorporation\nof starch granules into the model calculus.\nStarch treatments were initiated on day 9 (@fig-met-protocol) to avoid starch granule\ncounts being affected by $\\alpha$-amylase hydrolysis from the inoculation saliva.\nAn $\\alpha$-amylase\nassay conducted on samples from days 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 also showed that\nthere was no host salivary $\\alpha$-amylase activity in the system.\nThe results of the starch incorporation and $\\alpha$-amylase activity assay have\nbeen reported in a separate article [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].\n\nAfter 15 days, mineralisation was encouraged with a\ncalcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing\n20 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 12 mmol/l NaH~2~PO~4~, 5 mmol/l Na~2~PO~3~F, 500 mmol/l urea\n[@pearceConcomitantDeposition1987; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991],\nand 0.04 g/l MgCl. The substrata were submerged in 1 ml/well CPMU five times daily,\nevery two hours, for six minutes, at 30 rpm. During the mineralisation period,\nstarch treatments\nwere reduced to once per day, two hours after the last CPMU treatment. This cycle\nwas repeated\nfor 10 days until the end of the experiment on day 24\n(@fig-met-protocol). More detailed protocols are available at\n<https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.dm6gpj9rdgzp/v1>.\n\nAll laboratory work was conducted in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood\nto prevent starch and bacterial contamination. Starch-free control samples that\nwere only fed sucrose were included to detect starch contamination.\n\n### Metagenomics\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dna-samples .cell tbl-cap='Number of samples taken during the experiment, separated by sampling day and sample type.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Sample type    | Sampling day|  n|\n|:--------------|------------:|--:|\n|saliva         |            0|  1|\n|saliva         |            3|  1|\n|saliva         |            5|  1|\n|medium         |            5|  2|\n|medium         |            7|  2|\n|medium         |            9|  2|\n|medium         |           12|  2|\n|medium         |           15|  2|\n|medium         |           18|  2|\n|medium         |           21|  2|\n|medium         |           24|  2|\n|model_calculus |           24| 16|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- move table to figure 1? or combine with FTIR samples? -->\n\nA total of 35 samples were taken during the experiment from\nthe donated saliva, artificial saliva, and from the\nbiofilm end-product on day 24 (@tbl-dna-samples).\nDNA extraction was performed at the Max Planck\nInstitute for the Science of Human History (Jena, Germany), using the DNeasy\nPowerSoil Kit from QIAGEN. C2 inhibitor removal step skipped, going directly\nto C3 step.\n\nThe DNA was sheared to 500bp through sonication with a Covaris M220\nFocused-ultrasonicator. Double-stranded libraries were prepared [@aronHalfUDG2020]\nand dual indexed [@stahlDoublestrandedIndexing2019], with the indexing protocol\nbeing adapted for longer DNA fragments. Briefly, the modifications consisted of\nadding 3 μl of DMSO to the indexing reaction, and extending the\namplification cycles to 95$^{\\circ}$C for 60 s, 58$^{\\circ}$C for 60 s, and\n72$^{\\circ}$C for 90 s. The libraries were paired-end sequenced on a NextSeq 500\nto 150bp, and demultiplexed by an in-house script.\n\n#### Preprocessing\n\nThe raw DNA reads were preprocessed using the\nnf-core/eager, v2.4.4\npipeline [@yatesEAGER2020]. The pipeline included adapter removal and read merging\nusing\nAdapterRemoval, v2.3.2\n[@AdapterRemovalv2].\nMerged reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38<!--link-->)\nusing\nBWA, v0.7.17-r1188\n[@BWA] (-n 0.01; -l 32), and unmapped reads were extracted using\nSamtools, v1.12.\nThe final step of the pipeline, metagenomic classification, was conducted in\nkraken, v2.1.2\n[@kraken2] using the Standard 60GB database\n(<https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/k2_standard_20220926.tar.gz>).\n\nEnvironmental reference samples were downloaded directly from ENA and from NCBI\nusing the SRA Toolkit.                                                            <!-- reference supp. mat.-->\nOral reference samples were downloaded from the Human Metagenome Project (HMP),\nand modern calculus samples from Velsko et al. [-@velskoDentalCalculus2017].\nFrom the HMP data, only paired reads were processed, singletons were removed.\n*In vitro* biofilm model samples\nfrom @edlundUncoveringComplex2018 were used as a reference.\nLinks to the specific\nsequences are included in the metadata. Human-filtered reads produced in this study were uploaded to ENA under\naccession number PRJEB61886.\n\n#### Authentication\n\nSpecies with lower than 0.001% relative abundance across all samples were removed\nfrom the species table.\nSourceTracker2 [@knightsSourceTracker2011] was used to estimate source composition\nof the abundance-filtered oral biofilm model samples using a Bayesian framework,\nand samples falling below 70% oral source were removed from downstream analyses.\nWell-preserved abundance-filtered\nsamples were compared to oral and environmental controls to detect potential\nexternal contamination.\nThe R package decontam v1.22.0 [@Rdecontam] was used\nto identify potential contaminants in the abundance-filtered table\nusing DNA concentrations with a probability threshold of 0.95\nand negative controls with a probability threshold of 0.05. Putative contaminant\nspecies were filtered out of the OTU tables for all downstream analyses.\n<!-- Authentication methods are described in more\ndetail in 06-reports/metagen-authentication.Rmd-->\n\n#### Community composition\n\nRelative abundances of communities were calculated at the species- and genus-level,\nas recommended for compositional data [@gloorMicrobiomeDatasets2017].\nShannon index and Pileou's evenness index were calculated on species-level OTU tables of all\nmodel and oral reference\nsamples using the vegan v2.6.4 R package [@Rvegan]. Shannon index\nwas calculated for all experimental samples to see if there is an overall loss or gain in\ndiversity and richness across the experiment.\nSparse principal component analysis (sPCA) was performed on model biofilm\nsamples to assess differences in microbial composition between samples within the experiment,\nand a separate sPCA analysis was performed on model calculus and oral\nreference samples. The sPCA analysis was conducted using the mixOmics v\n6.26.0\nR package [@RmixOmics].\n\nThe core microbiome was calculated by taking the mean genus-level relative abundance\nwithin each sample type for model calculus, modern reference calculus,\nsub- and supragingival plaque. Genera present at lower than 5% relative\nabundance were grouped into the category 'other'.\nInformation on the oxygen tolerance of bacterial species was downloaded from \nBacDive [@reimerBacDive2022] and all variations of the major categories anaerobe,\nfacultative anaerobe, and aerobe were combined into the appropriate major category.\nAt the time of writing,\n55.7%\nspecies were missing aerotolerance values. This was mitigated by aggregating genus-level\ntolerances to species with missing values, and may have some errors (although\nunlikely to make any significant difference).\n\n#### Differential abundance\n\nDifferential abundance of species was calculated using the Analysis of Compositions\nof Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC) method from the\nANCOMBC R package v2.4.0 [@linANCOMBC2020], with a species-level\nOTU table as input.

Samples are grouped by sample type (i.e. saliva,\nplaque, modern calculus, model calculus). To supplement the sPCA analyses, we\nvisualised the log-fold change of the top 30 species in each of principal components 1\nand 2, allowing us to see which species are enriched in the different samples and\ncausing clustering in the sPCA.\n\n### FTIR\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the mineral composition and level of crystallisation of the model\ndental calculus samples, we used Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.\nWe compared the spectra of model dental calculus with spectra of archaeological\nand modern dental calculus and used a built-in Omnic search library for\nmineral identification\n[@weinerInfraredSpectroscopy2010;@mentzerDistributionAuthigenic2014]. \nThe archaeological dental calculus was sampled from an isolated permanent tooth\nfrom Middenbeemster, a rural, 19th century Dutch site [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013].\nSamples were analysed at the Laboratory for Sedimentary Archaeology, Haifa University.\nThe analysis was conducted with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet is5 spectrometer in\ntransmission, at 4 cm$^{-1}$ resolution, with an average of 32 scans between 4000\nand 400 cm$^{-1}$ wavenumbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ftir-byoc .cell tbl-cap='Summary of samples used in FTIR analysis, including type of sample, sampling day, number of samples (n), and mean weight in mg.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Sample type    | Sampling day|  n| Weight (mg)|\n|:--------------|------------:|--:|-----------:|\n|biofilm        |            7|  2|        0.79|\n|biofilm        |           12|  3|        1.01|\n|biofilm        |           16|  7|        2.00|\n|biofilm        |           20|  6|        3.50|\n|model_calculus |           24|  8|        3.87|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis was conducted on 26 model calculus samples from days\n7, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (@tbl-ftir-byoc). Some samples from the same sampling day\nhad to be combined to provide enough material for analysis. Samples analysed with\nFTIR were grown during a separate experimental run from the samples sequenced for\nDNA, but following the same setup and protocol (as described above).\nSamples were analysed following the method\npresented in @asscherAtomicDisorder2011 and @asscherVariationsAtomic2011.\nA few $\\mu$g of each sample were repeatedly ground together with KBr and pressed\nin a 7 mm die under two tons of pressure using a Specac mini-pellet press\n(Specac Ltd., GS01152).\nRepeated measurements of the splitting factor (SF) of the absorbance bands at 605\nand 567 cm−1 wavenumbers were taken after each grind, and a\ngrind curve was produced following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011 to try and detect\nchanges in the hydroxyapatite crystallinity over time. Samples were\nground and analysed up to six times (sample suffix a-f) for the grinding curve.\nGrinding curves were prepared for samples from days 16, 20, and 24. No grind\ncurves were produced for samples from days 7 and 12. These were largely composed\nof organics and proteins, and did not form enough mineral (hydroxyapatite) for\nanalysis. The splitting factor of carbonate hydroxyapatite was calculated using\na macro script, following @weinerStatesPreservation1990. The calculation involves\ndividing the sum of\nthe height of the absorptions at 603 cm$^{-1}$ and 567 cm$^{-1}$ by the height\nof the valley between them. Following @asscherAtomicDisorder2011 and\n@asscherVariationsAtomic2011, we plotted the\nsplitting factor against the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main absorption\nat 1035-1043 cm$^{-1}$ to explore crystallinity (crystal size) and the order and\ndisorder of hydroxyapatite. We then compared our grinding curve slopes and FWHM\nto the ones produced by @asscherVariationsAtomic2011. @asscherVariationsAtomic2011\nand @asscherAtomicDisorder2011\ndemonstrated that while the decrease in FWHM of each grinding in the curve reflects\na decrease in particle size due to grinding, the location of the curves within a\nplot of the FWHM against the splitting factor expresses the disorder effect.\nThus the curves with steeper slopes, higher splitting factor, and lower FWHM\nrepresent lower levels of disorder in the mineral\n[Figure 2 in @asscherVariationsAtomic2011].\n\n### Statistics\n\n<!-- R packages used -->\nStatistical analysis was conducted in R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31)\n(Pile of Leaves) [@Rbase].

The model calculus\nsamples from the end of the experiment are similar to both the modern and\narchaeological reference samples. The main difference is a lower organic component\nin reference samples seen as a reduced amide I peak at around 1637 compared to\nthe carbonate peak at around 1420, and an absence of amide II and III. Further,\nthere is a reduction in CH3 bands at 3000-2900 cm$^{-1}$ ([@fig-ftir-spectra]A-D).\n\nSample spectra from days 7 and 12 are characterised by a high content of proteins as evident\nby the strong amide I absorbance band at 1650, a less pronounced amide II band\nat 1545 cm$^{-1}$, and the small amide III band at 1237 cm$^{-1}$. Related\nto the organic component of the samples are also the three marked CH~3~ and CH~2~\nstretching vibrations at 2960, 2920, and 2850 cm$^{-1}$ wavenumbers. The presence\nof mineral component is evident from the presence of C--O$^{2-}_3$ absorbance\nbands at 1450 and 1400 cm$^{-1}$ wavenumbers typical of carbonates, and\nP--O$^{3-}_4$ absorbance band at 1080 and 1056 cm$^{-1}$ which are related to\nphosphate minerals. There is a large variation between the spectra, possibly\nindicating different formation rates of the different components in the samples\n([@fig-ftir-spectra]A and B).\n\nIn spectra from days 16 to 24, the ratio of amides to PO~4~ has shifted, with\nthe main peak shifting to the PO~4~ v~3~ absorbance band at 1039--1040 cm$^{-1}$,\nindicating that the main component of\nthe samples is carbonate hydroxyapatite. A well-defined PO~4~ doublet at 600 and\n560 is present. Small CO$_3^{2-}$ asymmetric stretching at 1450 cm$^{-1}$ and\n1415 cm$^{-1}$, and stretching vibrations at 875-870 cm$^{-1}$ indicate that the\ncarbonate minerals component is also becoming more crystallised.

Our proposed use of the model is to address\na variety of research questions related to dietary information extracted from\ndental calculus, in both modern and archaeological samples.\nFor that to be feasible, the model needs to serve as a viable proxy to\ndental calculus grown under natural conditions, i.e., in the human oral cavity.\nIt needs, as much as possible, to mimic the diversity and complexity of the\nnatural oral microbiome, while also offering control over factors such as dietary\ninput, growth conditions, and replicability within and between experiments.\nHere, we assessed the viability of our model as a proxy for dental calculus\nusing metagenomic classification and FTIR analysis to explore the bacterial\nand mineral composition, and compare with oral reference samples.\n\n### Microbiome\n\n<!-- diversity and complexity within experiment and compared to oral references -->\nModel calculus has lower species diversity than inocula saliva and oral reference\nsamples, which is a common limitation in biofilm models\n[@edlundBiofilmModel2013; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013]. The donated saliva for the\nexperiment had a lower diversity than the reference saliva samples, and may have\ncontributed to a lower diversity in experimental samples. Consequently, there is\nalso a lower diversity and richness when compared to other modern oral reference\nsamples, including oral mucosa, saliva, plaque, and calculus.\nSamples of the medium from early in the experiment have similar species profiles\nto the donated saliva, but gradually diverge over the course of the experiment.\nThis may be caused by experimental setup not sufficiently mimicking the oral\nenvironment, allowing species\nto thrive that do not normally thrive in the natural oral environment.\n\nOral reference samples have a relative abundance of streptococci similar\nto our model, but a more diverse representation from other genera and an overall\nhigher species diversity and richness than our model.\nReference samples also had a more diverse aerotolerance profile than our model,\nwhich primarily consisted of (faculatative) anaerobes. Species within\npredominantly aerobic genera, are deficient in the model, suggesting a shift from a\nlargely aerotolerant profile to an anaerobic profile during the experiment.\nWhile our model is not set up as an anaerobic system, the anaerobes seem to\nhave outcompeted aerobes and, to some extent, facultative anaerobes.\nThis is likely a result of communities of bacteria within the biofilm creating\nfavourable microenvironments facilitated by the protective properties of the\nbiofilm matrix [@flemmingBiofilmsEmergent2016; @edlundUncoveringComplex2018].\n\nOverall, the majority of model calculus samples contained a distinctly oral\nsignature, providing a promising starting point for the use of the model as a\nviable proxy to dental calculus. The main differences between model and oral\nreference samples may be due to human variation, as there can be large differences\nin the oral microbiome of two individuals at the species level due to variations\nin age, sex, and other demographic factors, as well as how and when saliva samples\nwere collected [@burchamPatternsOral2020; @nearingAssessingVariation2020].\nWhether or not distinct microbial profiles, and the extracellular matrix\nthey produce, will affect the retention of dietary particles in plaque remains to\nbe seen, but is an important question to address in the future. \n\n### Mineralisation\n\nFTIR analysis allowed us to address the mineralisation process of the model,\nwhich showed an increasing mineral composition over the course of the\nexperiment. As the model biofilm matured, the predominantly organic content of\nearly samples was replaced by inorganic content in the form of carbonated\nhydroxyapatite, consistent with a shift from a high presence of bacterial cells\nin a matrix of extracellular polysaccharides\n[@jainIsolationCharacterization2013; @sutherlandBiofilmMatrix2001; @zhangMeasurementPolysaccharides1998]\nto a predominantly mineral content.\n\nThe model calculus samples resemble both the modern reference calculus and\nthe archaeological calculus in mineral composition and crystallinity. The steeper\nslope in the grind curve plots of the archaeological sample suggests that the\ncrystals in archaeological samples are larger, and hence more ordered than in\nmodel calculus. A possible explanation is that\nthe inorganic crystals within archaeological calculus have had more time to grow\ninto the space left by degraded organic matter [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010];\nhowever, we only analysed one archaeological sample and cannot definitively\naddress this. The short duration of model calculus growth may also have affected\nthe results, compared to the longer-term growth and mineralisation of natural calculus.\nThe constant disruptions in growth of *in vivo* dental plaque/calculus, due to\noral hygiene and other external pressures on biofilm growth, may lead to\nmultiple stages of calcium phosphates, whereas our model has more stable\ngrowth conditions.\n\nOne of the most well-known biomineralisers, *Corynebacterium matruchotii*\n[@enneverCharacterizationBacterionema1978; @takazoeCalciumHydroxyapatite1970],\nexhibited a lower abundance in our model calculus compared to modern\nreference calculus. However, the mineral composition of the end results were similar,\nreinforcing the idea that, under the right circumstances, biofilms with a range\nof microbial profiles can facilitate mineralisation\n[@moorerCalcificationCariogenic1993].\nBacteria and their ability to secrete an extracellular matrix are integral in the\nformation of dental calculus, and inevitably serve as part of the structure that\ndental calculus is built upon [@rohanizadehUltrastructuralStudy2005], while the\nexact species composition of the biofilm communities may be less important.\n\n### Replicability\n\nModel calculus displayed similar species diversity and microbial profiles\nacross all samples, indicating a high level of replicability between samples\nin the experimental run.\nIt remains to be seen whether the replicability within the experiment\nalso scales up to between-experiment replicability in our model, though others\nhave already shown that replicability in long-term models is possible when using\nthe same inocula [@velskoConsistentReproducible2018].\nThe variation in mineral composition in our model was initially high, but samples\nfrom day 24 were largely similar in composition as observed in the FTIR spectra.\nThe use of a simple multiwell plate setup allows us to submit many samples\nto the same conditions, increasing replicability between samples [@extercateAAA2010].\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile our in vitro model calculus system provides reproducible and consistent\nartificial dental calculus for archaeological research, as demonstrated by the\nspecies composition and the mineralisation properties, we recognise the model\nhas several limitations.\nOur single-donor approach may have affected the diversity of the model. The donated\nsaliva from our study had a lower mean Shannon Index than other saliva samples.\nThe lower diversity may be caused by only using one donor instead of pooling saliva\nfrom multiple individuals. However, having a single inoculum donor allows us to maintain\nthe integrity of a native oral microbiome which may be lost when samples\nare pooled [@edlundBiofilmModel2013]. \nIt is also possible that the diversity was affected\nby the collection and storage methods we used. This has been shown to have\nminimal effect on microbial profiles at the genus level [@limSalivaMicrobiome2017],\nbut some effect on beta diversity calculations [@omoriComparativeEvaluation2021].  \n\nSome samples were grown with starch-sucrose solutions as nutrients, while controls\nwere grown with sucrose only. Due to the financial cost, we did not sequence enough\nsamples of each nutrient treatment to assess the influence of starch on the microbial\ncommunity or mineral composition.\nBiofilms were grown in a standard shaking bacterial growth incubator, rather than\nan incubator specific to cell cultures. The lack of complex environmental control\nmay cause the model to deviate from its natural growth over the 25 days that the\nexperiment is run, due to a lack of precise control over conditions such as\npH and salivary flow rates.\n\nThere is also the possibility that contamination was introduced into the model during\nthe experiment. While the CPMU solution was\nprepared under sterile conditions, the solution itself was not autoclaved or\nfilter-sterilised. In the species composition metagenomic analysis, all\nmedium samples collected after the introduction of CPMU on day 14 were removed by the\nauthentication step because the majority of species appeared to derive from\nenvironmental sources indicating external contamination.\nGoing forward we recommend filter-sterilising solutions that are not autoclaved.  \n\nTo avoid disturbing the growth and development of our biofilm, we took\nsamples of media from the bottom of the wells after three days without full media\nreplacement, careful not to disturb other plate-bound biofilms.\nThe samples may therefore not fully reflect the composition of the biofilm itself.\nGoing forward we recommend sampling from the actual biofilm, as this is\nthe sample type under investigation.  \n\n<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->\n\n### Future work\n\nFurther protocol optimisation will also be necessary to address some of the\nlimitations of our current model, such as reducing the frequency of\nmedium replacement (currently every three days) to help promote the\ngrowth of slow-growing fastidious organisms and limit generalists such as enterococci,\nand supplementing it with serum to provide additional nutrients and biofilm\nstability [@tianUsingDGGE2010; @ammannZurichBiofilm2012].\nMore infrequent medium replacement would facilitate slow-growing bacteria in\nestablishing their metabolic relationships, allowing the byproducts of some species\nto become abundant enough for others that depend on these to grow [@marshDentalPlaque2005].  \n\nOur goals for additional validation measures involve functional profiles of bacteria,\nto see if metabolic behaviour of bacteria is consistent with *in vivo* conditions,\nand whether this is affected by the presence/absence of amylase and starch treatments.\nThe absence of host salivary $\\alpha$-amylase activity in our model\n(as shown in @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022) provides\nan opportunity to explore the effect of various amylase levels on biofilm growth\nand composition, as well as the incorporation of dietary compounds in dental calculus.\n\nThe model can also be used to explore limitations and biases of methods used to\nreconstruct past dietary patterns from dental calculus. To this end,\nsucrose and raw starch treatments can be replaced with other dietary components\nof interest, such as cooked starches, whole plant extracts, and various proteins.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe bacterial profile of our model calculus is not an exact match to the natural\nmodern or archaeological reference calculus, but species richness and diversity\nfalls within a similar range as the reference *in vitro* model, and the core genera\nare predominantly oral.\nOur model calculus had a distinct microbial profile from modern reference calculus,\nbut a similar mineral composition to modern and archaeological reference calculus,\nconsisting of carbonate hydroxyapatite and similar levels of crystallinity and\norder, with a slightly higher organic phase.<!-- rephrase -->\n\nOur model has many potential benefits within archaeological\nresearch, especially since the setup does not require highly specialised equipment,\nmaking it accessible to many labs within the archaeological sciences.\nIt can be used to test many fundamental aspects of\nthe process of incorporation, retention, and subsequent extraction of various dietary\ncomponents from archaeological dental calculus.\nUsing an oral biofilm model in a controlled environment with known dietary input,\nwe can learn more about how different methods of food processing in the past\nmay affect results of dental calculus analyses, and how the methods we use\nmay further distort this picture. Our method can be used to test methods\n(e.g. DNA, proteomics, etc.), decontamination protocols, as well as training on\nthese methods and protocols without depleting limited archaeological resources.\nThe purpose of our model is not to replace studies conducted on archaeological\nand natural dental calculus, but rather to balance limitations of each method\nand serve as a complementary approach to expand our toolkit.\n<!-- ultimately we are left with more questions than answers, but isn't that the \nbeauty of science? -->\n\n\n\n## References cited\n",
