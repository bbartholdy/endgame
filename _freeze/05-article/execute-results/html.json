The increased accessibility and advancement of methods in\naDNA, paleoproteomics, and mass spectrometry, has expanded our ability to identify\nbiomarkers of diet and disease on an increasingly large scale\n[@warinnerEvidenceMilk2014; @velskoDentalCalculus2017; @gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].\n\n<!-- define alkaloids -->\nOne such collection of biomarkers is alkaloids, a plant-derived group of compounds.\nMany alkaloids\nhave important medicinal and psychoactive effects in humans, and their direct\ndetection, or detection of their metabolites, is of great interest to archaeologists.\nPrevious studies have successfully recovered alkaloids in archaeological\ncontexts, including ceramics [@smithDetectionOpium2018], pipes\n[@raffertyCurrentResearch2012], human hair\n[@ogaldeIdentificationPsychoactive2009; @echeverriaNicotineHair2013], and even\ndental calculus employing both targeted [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018] and\nuntargeted approaches\n[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].\nEspecially nicotine, the principal alkaloid in tobacco leaves,\nhas been widely studied in the archaeological record due to its apparent stability\nand ability to survive over long periods of time\n[@eerkensDentalCalculus2018; @raffertyCurrentResearch2012; @tushinghamHuntergathererTobacco2013].\n\n<!--how are compounds incorporated in dental calculus-->\nAlkaloids may enter the oral cavity via two pathways: (1) direct\nincorporation through ingestion of alkaloid-containing plants, whether\ndeliberate or accidental;\nand (2) passive diffusion as alkaloids and other compounds are transferred from\nplasma to saliva, and then gradually secreted into the oral cavity through the\nsalivary glands in the hours-to-days following ingestion [@coneInterpretationOral2007].\nThe second pathway allows the identification of parent compounds that do not enter\nthe mouth (e.g. injection), as long as they, or their metabolites, are excreted\nthrough the saliva, thus eventually entering the oral cavity.\n\n<!--cite e.g. injection or topical The second pathway may also be more\ndetectable, as the excretion of compounds through saliva may take hours to days\nwhereas compounds spend less time in the oral cavity during direct consumption.-->\n\nMany of the components involved in the formation and growth of dental calculus\noriginate from oral fluid. Proteins, bacteria, salts and other compounds are\ntransferred from saliva to biofilms on the tooth surface\n[@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nThis may also allow various alkaloids of dietary and medicinal origin to become\nincorporated in dental plaque. Dental plaque undergoes frequent mineralisation\nevents, ultimately causing the entrapped alkaloids and their metabolites to become\npreserved within the dental calculus. Barring intentional or accidental removal of\nthe calculus during life,\nburial, excavation, and post-excavation cleaning, the alkaloids can then be detected\nby various methods to show a record of consumption during life.\nBecause drugs may be transferred from plasma to saliva,\nthere is often a close correlation between drugs detected in\noral fluid and blood, though there are differences in detected concentrations\n[@coneInterpretationOral2007; @willeRelationshipOral2009; @milmanOralFluid2011].\nThis was also shown to be true for dental calculus and blood [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021],\nmaking dental calculus a potentially useful substance for detecting ancient\nalkaloids and other dietary compounds.\n\n<!--brief description of method validation-->\nIn this study we use a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass\nspectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method that was developed in a previous study on dental\ncalculus from cadavers and validated by comparing the results to compounds detected\nin the blood of the same individuals [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].\nAll compounds that were detected in the blood were also detected in dental calculus,\nwith additional compounds present in dental calculus that were not present\nin blood, suggesting that dental calculus represents a comprehensive history of\nconsumption over a long period of time [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].\n<!--summary of results-->\nWe were able to detect both parent compounds and metabolites, including caffeine,\nnicotine, theophylline, and cotinine, in the dental calculus of individuals from\na 19th century Dutch population from Middenbeemster. By detecting these compounds\nwe are able to show the consumption\nof tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also\nconfirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the\ndentition.\n\n\n\n## Materials {#mb11CalculusPilot-mat}\n\n<!-- Demographics and description of MB11 sample, selection criteria. -->\nThe sample consists of 41 individuals from Middenbeemster,\na 19th century rural Dutch site.\nThe village of Middenbeemster and the surrounding Beemsterpolder was established\nin the beginning of the 17th century, when the Beemster lake was drained to\ncreate more farmland, mainly for the cultivation of cole seeds (de Vries 1978).\nIn 1615, a decision was made to build a church, and\nconstruction started in 1618 (Hakvoort 2013). The excavated cemetery is associated\nwith the Keyserkerk church, where the inhabitants of the Middenbeemster village\nand the surrounding Beemsterpolder were buried between AD 1615 and 1866\n[@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013]. Archival documents are available for those buried\nbetween AD 1829 and 1866, when the majority of individuals were interred.\nThe main occupation of the inhabitants\nwas dairy farming, consisting largely of manual labour prior to the industrial\nrevolution [@aten400Jaar2012; @palmerActivityReconstruction2016].\n\nFor our sample, we preferentially selected males from the middle adult age category\n(35-49 years) to minimise the effect of confounding cultural and biological factors.\nPrevious research on Middenbeemster has shown a gendered division of labour\n[@palmerActivityReconstruction2016], and there are biological differences in\ndental calculus formation and drug metabolism that are related to age and sex\n[@huangDecipheringGenetic2023; @unoSexAgedependent2017; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nThe sample consists of 27 males,\n11 probable males,\n2 probable females, and\n1 female (@fig-sample-demography).\nWe selected males due to a higher\noccurrence of pipe notches and dental calculus deposits than females (unpublished observation).\n\n<!-- use plot to show original and replicated sample demographics? -->\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overview of sample demography.

Sex was estimated using cranial\nand pelvic morphological traits [@Standards1994]. Age-at-death was estimated using\ndental wear,\nauricular and pubic surface appearance, cranial suture closure, and epiphyseal fusion \n[@Standards1994; @SucheyBrooks1990; @buckberryAuricular2002; @lovejoyAuricular1985; @meindlSutureClosure1985],\nand divided into the following categories:\nearly young adult (18-24 years), late young adult (25-34 years), middle adult\n(35-49 years), old adult (50+ years). Preservation was visually scored on a\nfour-stage scale (excellent, good, fair, poor) based on the surface condition of\nthe bones and the extent of taphonomic degradation.\n\n#### Paleopathology\n\nPathological conditions and lesions that occur frequently in the population were\nincluded in the analysis. Data were\ndichotomised to presence/absence to allow for statistical analysis.\nOsteoarthritis was considered present in cases where eburnation was visible\non one or more joint surfaces.\nVertebral osteophytosis is identified by marginal lipping and/or osteophyte\nformation on the margin of the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral\nbody.\nCribra orbitalia was diagnosed based on the presence of pitting on the superior\nsurface of the orbit. No distinction was made between active or healing lesions.\nDegenerative disc disease, or spondylosis, is identified as a large diffuse\ndepression of the\nsuperior and/or inferior surfaces of the vertebral body [@rogersPalaeopathologyJoint2000].\nSchmorl's nodes are identified as any cortical depressions on the surface of\nthe vertebral body.\nData on chronic maxillary sinusitis from @casnaUrbanizationRespiratory2021 were\nincluded in this study to assess the relationship between upper respiratory\ndiseases with environmental factors (i.e. tobacco smoke, caffeine consumption).\nLesions associated with chronic maxillary sinusitis as defined by\n@boocockMaxillarySinusitis1995 were\nrecorded for each individual and classified as \"pitting\", \"spicule-type bone\nformation\", \"remodeled spicules\", or \"white pitted bone\".\nchronic maxillary sinusitis was scored as absent\nwhen the sinus presented smooth surfaces with little or no associated pitting.\n\n#### Dental pathology\n\nCaries ratios were calculated by dividing the number of lesions by the number\nof teeth scored, resulting in a single caries ratio per individual. If the surface\nwhere the lesion originated is not visible, i.e. if the lesion covered multiple\nsurfaces, this was scored as \"crown\".\nCalculus indices were calculated according to Greene and colleagues [-@greeneQuantifyingCalculus2005].\nCalculus was scored with a four-stage scoring system (0-3) to score absent, slight,\nmoderate, and heavy calculus deposits [@brothwellDiggingBones1981]\non the lingual, buccal (and labial), and interproximal surfaces of each tooth. Only\none score was used for the combined interproximal surfaces, resulting in three\nscores per tooth (when surfaces are intact), and four calculus indices per individual;\nupper anterior, upper posterior, lower anterior, lower posterior.\nEach index was calculated by dividing\nthe sum of calculus scores for each surface by the total number of surfaces scored\nin each quadrant. If a tooth could not be scored on all three surfaces, the tooth\nwas not included [@greeneQuantifyingCalculus2005].\nPeriodontitis was scored on a visual four-stage (0-3) scoring system according to\ndistance from cemento-enamel junction of each tooth to alveolar bone [@maatManualPhysical2005].\n\n### Calculus sampling\n\nWhere possible, we used material that had already been sampled for a previous\nstudy to prevent unnecessary repeated sampling of individuals. \nCalculus from the previous study was\nsampled in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory at the Laboratories of Molecular\nAnthropology and Microbiome Research in Norman, Oklahoma, U.S.A,\nusing established ancient DNA protocols. More details on the methods can be found\nin the published articles\n[@ziesemer16SChallenges2015; @ziesemerGenomeCalculus2018]. \nOf the 41 individuals that were originally included in our sample,\n29\nwere replicated in a separate analysis only using calculus from the previous study.  \nNew dental calculus samples were taken under sterile conditions in a positive\npressure laminar flow hood in a dedicated dental calculus lab at Leiden University.\nThe surface of the tooth was lightly brushed with a sterile, disposable toothbrush\nto get rid of surface contaminants. A sterile dental curette was then used to\nscrape calculus from the tooth onto weighing paper, which was transferred to 1.5 ml\nEppendorf tubes.\nAll calculus samples were sent to the Department of Forensic Medicine at Aarhus University\nfor ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)\nanalysis.\n\n### UHPLC-MS/MS\n\nThe list of targeted compounds included both naturally occurring compounds known\nto have been used in the past, as well as synthetic modern drugs that did not exist\nat the time (e.g. Fentanyl, MDMA, Amphetamine). These were part of the toxicology\nscreening for the original method [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021],\ndeveloped on cadavers. In our study they serve as an authentication step, as their\npresence in archaeological samples could only be the result of contamination.\n\nBriefly, samples of dental calculus were washed three times each with one mL of\nmethanol (MeOH), to remove surface contaminants. The wash solutions were collected\nseparately. The solvent was\nevaporated and the residues were dissolved in 50 µL 30% MeOH.\nThe washed calculus was homogenized in presence of 0.5 M citric acid using a lysing\ntube with stainless steel beads. Following one hour of incubation the dissolution\nextract was cleaned by weak and strong cation-exchange. After evaporation of the\nelution solvent the residue was dissolved in 50 µL 30% MeOH.\nThe final extracts obtained from washing and dissolution of the dental calculus were\nanalysed by UHPLC-MS/MS using a reversed-phase biphenyl column for chromatography.\nTo obtain quantitative results, isotope dilution was applied.\nFor more details about the method and validation, see the original study by\nSørensen and colleagues [-@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nAll compounds and pathological conditions/lesions were converted to a presence/absence\nscore. Pearson product-moment correlation was applied to the\ndichotomised pathological lesions (point-biserial correlation),\ncompound concentrations, calculus indices, and caries ratios to explore relationships\npaired continuous-continuous variables and paired continuous-binary variables.\nCompound concentrations were then dichotomised to presence/absence, and\nthe caries ratio and calculus index for each individual were converted to an\nordinal score from 0 to 4 by using quartiles. Polychoric correlation was applied\nto the paired dichotomous variables and dichotomous-ordinal variables.\n<!--Median periodontal scores were calculated for each individual. -->\n\nAll statistical analysis was conducted in R version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24),\nPuppy Cup, [@Rbase]. Data wrangling was conducted with the **tidyverse**\n[@tidyverse2019] and visualisations were created using **ggplot2** [@ggplot2].\nPolychoric correlations were calculated with the **psych** package [@Rpsych].\n\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n<!-- detected compounds -->\nMultiple compounds were detected in the dental calculus samples.

We applied ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem\nmass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using a method that was validated by co-occurrence\nof drugs and metabolites in dental calculus and blood [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].\nHere we have shown that the method can also be successfully applied to archaeological\ndental calculus.\nWe extend findings from previous studies on alkaloids in archaeological samples\nby detecting multiple different alkaloids in dental calculus, including\nnicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid. The detection of\nthese compounds was solidified in a replication analysis on different samples\nfrom the same individuals.\nCocaine and multiple cannabinoids were also detected during the first\nanalysis, but were not replicated.\nWe contextualize these findings within the historical and\narchaeological evidence for consumption of these drugs and dietary compounds.\n\n<!-- compounds detected with potential sources, and those that were surprisingly missing -->\n<!-- nicotine and cotinine: tobacco, obviously...-->\nNicotine and its principal/main metabolite, cotinine, were strongly positively correlated,\nboth in concentration and presence/absence in individuals (@tbl-pearson and @fig-polycorr).\nThe detection of nicotine and cotinine is not surprising, as pipe-smoking in the\nBeemsterpolder is well-documented in the literature\n[@aten400Jaar2012; @boumanBegravenis2017], and visible on the skeletal\nremains as pipe notches [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013].\nThere is also documented medicinal use of nicotine in the Beemsterpolder,\nwhere a tobacco-smoke enema was used for headaches, respiratory problems, colds,\nand drowsiness from around 1780 to 1830 [@aten400Jaar2012].\nIn our sample, we also detected nicotine and cotinine (replicated)\nin an old adult, probable female individual.\nIn this particular case it is unlikely that the compounds entered the dental\ncalculus through pipe-smoking, as the individual had no visible pipe notches;\nmore likely the tobacco entered through an alternate mode of consumption,\nsecondhand smoke, or the aforementioned tobacco-smoke enema.\n\n<!-- Scientific findings as extension of previous work -->\n\n<!-- strong correlation between nicotine and cotinine concentration is important?\n      Could suggest that the incorporation pathway is excretion, not consumption\n        - longer time in body than mouth (consumption)\n-->\n\n<!-- theophylline and caffeine: anyone fancy a cuppa? -->\nTheophylline and caffeine were positively correlated in our samples, though to a\nlesser extent than nicotine and cotinine, so we are unable to determine if they\noriginated from the same source (@tbl-pearson and @fig-polycorr).\nCaffeine and theophylline have very similar chemical structures, so we expect\nthey would experience similar rates of incorporation and degradation, allowing\nus to interpret the ratio and correlations between the compounds.\nCaffeine is present in coffee, tea, and cocoa beans, with concentrations slightly\nhigher in coffee\n[@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988; @chinCaffeineContent2008; @bispoSimultaneousDetermination2002; @srdjenovicSimultaneousHPLC2008].\nTheophylline is present in both coffee beans and tea leaves, but in negligible\nquantities [@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988]. It is also a primary metabolite of\ncaffeine produced by the liver. Given the low correlation, there are likely\nmultiple sources of caffeine and theophylline in the population, with tea and\ncoffee being the most obvious.  \nTea consumption had become widespread in the Netherlands by 1820, reaching all\nparts of society [@nierstraszTeaTrade2015, p.91].\nHistorically, we also know that both tea and coffee were consumed in the\nBeemsterpolder during the 19th century. 'Theegasten' (teatime) was a special\noccasion occurring from 15.00-20.00 hours, where tea was served along with the evening\nbread [@schuijtemakerTeTheegasten2011]. Many households also owned at least one\ncoffee pot and tea pot [@boumanBegravenis2017].\nDistinguishing between tea, coffee, and chocolate may be possible by also including\ntheobromine and comparing ratios of the compounds, as theobromine is present in\nhigher quantities in chocolate compared to caffeine and theophylline\n[@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988; @bispoSimultaneousDetermination2002; @alanonAssessmentFlavanol2016].\nHowever, In addition to oral factors\naffecting alkaloid uptake in dental calculus, there is some indication that\ntheobromine does not preserve well in the archaeological record\n[@velskoDentalCalculus2017], and frequent consumption of all three items would\nbe difficult to parse. Additionally, we do not understand well enough the\neffect of the burial on these specific compounds, and the original concentration of\nthe compounds in plants can be quite variable [@kingCautionaryTales2017].\n\n<!-- salicylic acid: diet, medicine, or environment??? -->\nSalicylic acid was found in all but one individual in our sample.\nIt can be extracted from the bark of willow trees, *Salix alba*, and\nhas long been used for its\npain-relieving properties [@bruinsmaBijdragenTot1872, p. 119]. It is also present\nin many plant-based foods\n[@duthieNaturalSalicylates2011; @malakarNaturallyOccurring2017], including\npotatoes, which were a staple of the Beemsterpolder diet [@aten400Jaar2012].\nThe extracted quantity from our samples decreased over the three washes, followed\nby a sharp increase in the final calculus extraction, which is what we would expect\nto see if the salicylic acid was incorporated during life (@fig-auth-plot-batch2).\nIt is important to note that, especially with salicylic acid, there is a possibility\nfor the compound to enter the calculus through contact with the surrounding soil.\nSalicylic acid is a very mobile organic acid\n[@chenCa2Dependent2001; @badriRegulationFunction2009] and the ubiqutous presence\nin our samples may be explained by the compound leching into the dental calculus\nfrom the burial environment.\nWe can therefore not confidently rule out environmental contamination without\nanalysing samples from the surrounding soil.\n\n<!-- cannabinoids: oh cool! medicinal? wait, where did they go..? -->\nCannabinoids---specifically THC, THCA-A, THCVA, CBD, CBN---were found in the\nfirst batch, but none were replicated in the second batch. Medicinal use of\ncannabinoids has been well-established in Europe since Medieval-times, and it\nwas also grown in the Netherlands [@bruinsmaBijdragenTot1872].\nAdministration was most common in the form of concoctions containing various portions\nof the cannabis plant for ingestion; not until the late 19th century did it become\nrecommended to smoke it for more immediate effects [@clarkeCannabisEvolution2013].\nDutch medicinal preparations were used to treat a variety of ailments and symptoms,\nincluding pain, inflammation, various stomach ailments, gout, and joint pains\n[@clarkeCannabisEvolution2013].\nBecause cannabinoids have an affinity for protein-binding, they are less likely\nto diffuse from serum to saliva [@coneInterpretationOral2007]. This may make them\ndifficult to detect in dental calculus unless the cannibinoids were consumed\norally; even then,\nthe overall instability of some cannabinoids could also limit detection\n[@sorensenEffectAntioxidants2018; @lindholstLongTerm2010].\nGiven the lack of replication, we cannot with security confirm that\ncannabis was used by the Beemster population.\n \n<!-- opioids: Damn... that would've been awesome -->\nDespite many of our sampled individuals having lived during the height of the opium era\nin the Netherlands [@machtHistoryOpium1915], none of the targeted opioids\n(morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, norcodeine, noscapine)\nwere detected. \nThe absence of opioids could be a result of the people ascribing more to the\n\"traditional\" rather than \"scientific\" medicine, although laudanum and\nanother opium containing concoction was part of the \"traditional\" medicine in\nthe Netherlands [@leuwProhibitionLegalization1994], including Middenbeemster\n[@aten400Jaar2012]. It was also generally\nconsidered a drug of the upper class [@scheltemaOpiumTrade1907], and may have been\nmore common in urban centers.\nThe absence could also be attributed to postmortem degradation.\nIt has been shown that, while morphine is abundant in opium, it\ndegrades rapidly. Thebaine and papaverine are more resistant to various\nageing processes [@chovanecOpiumMasses2012], however, these were also absent from\nour samples.\n\n<!-- authentication -->\n<!-- the importance of replication - brief discussion of cocaine -->\nThe only strictly modern compound (at least in a European context) detected in the sample\nwas cocaine, which was detected in the first batch of samples. Our sample is\nderived from an early--mid 19th century population, and cocaine was isolated in 1860\nby Albert Niemann, and entered popular medical\npractice in 1884. Coca arrived in Europe as early as 1771, but as botanical\nspecimens rather than for consumption, and there were also issues importing enough\nviable specimens of coca for cocaine extraction\n[@mortimerHistoryCoca1901 p. 179; @abucaCocaTrade2019, p.108].\nThis would have been the first case of coca-leaf-consumption in Europe; however,\nwe were unable to replicate any of the cocaine results in the second batch.\nWe suspect that the original detection of cocaine was a result of lab contamination\nduring analysis.<!--and hope this will serve as a reminder of the importance of replication.-->\n\n<!-- correlations with skeletal indicators -->\nWe explored the relationship between detected compounds and various skeletal\nindicators, such as pathological and dental lesions, preservation, and pipe notches.\nWe found some evidence to suggest that preservation of the skeleton influences\nthe recovery of compounds from the dental calculus, with well-preserved skeletons\npotentially serving as a better target for sampling.  \nWe found a positive correlation between CMS and nicotine, which may be\nindicative of the impact tobacco smoking had on the respiratory health of the\nBeemster inhabitants.\nTobacco smoke may play a significant role in diseases\nof the upper respiratory tract, including chronic maxillary sinusitis\n[@rehImpactTobacco2012]. Although\nthe mechanisms by which smoking increases the risk of infections is not fully\nunderstood, solid evidence has been presented linking tobacco smoke to\nincreased mucosal permeability and impairment of mucociliary clearance\n[@arcaviCigaretteSmoking2004]. Such changes, together with an altered immunologic\nresponse, are thought to predispose to the development of chronic maxillary sinusitis\n[@slavinDiagnosisManagement2005].  \nWe also observed a moderate positive correlation between chronic maxillary sinusitis\nand caffeine which\ncontradicts previous research linking chronic coffee consumption with a positive\neffect on the respiratory system, suggesting a preventive association between\ncaffeine intake and pneumonia\n[e.g. @alfaroChronicCoffee2018; @kondoAssociationCoffee2021].\nHowever, while the\nlower respiratory tract seems to benefit from chronic coffee consumption, it is\npossible that elevated caffeine intake impacts mucosal moisture due to its\ndehydrating effect [@maughanCaffeineIngestion2003], thereby exposing individuals\nto greater risk of sinus infection. \n\n<!-- Findings' scientific implications -->\n\n<!-- secondary findings-->\n\nThe detection of nicotine in dental calculus has previously been presented by\nEerkens and colleagues [-@eerkensDentalCalculus2018] in two individuals from\npre-contact California. They also targeted caffeine, cotinine, and theophylline\nin their samples, but were unable to detect any of them. It remains to be seen\nwhether this is due to differences in methods used, or due to our samples being\nmore recent.\nThey also suggest that the choice of tooth for sampling may impact the detection\nof certain compounds,\nas the incorporation in dental calculus may depend on the mode of consumption.\nTobacco smokers may have more\nnicotine present in calculus on incisors, whereas tobacco chewers may have more\non molars [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018].\nHowever, sampling may not be limited to mode of consumption.\nThe presence of cotinine suggests that the excretion of a compound after being\nmetabolised in the body is also a source of deposition, and\nthat deposition of alkaloids in dental calculus can occur both on the way into\nthe body, i.e. during consumption, and on the way out, i.e. disposal of waste\nproducts via saliva secretion into the mouth.\nEspecially mucin-rich saliva from the sublingual\nand submandibular glands preferentially binds toxins [@doddsHealthBenefits2005],\nand since these glands are located closest to the lower incisors, they may be the\nmost effective target for these studies.\nThis has yet to be systematically\ntested in archaeological dental calculus.\nBecause we homogenised samples from multiple teeth of an individual, we were unable\nto test the effect of oral biogeography.\nIt is also possible that resident microflora within\nbiofilms contribute to alkaloid breakdown and that the presence of caffeine and\nnicotine metabolites following direct ingestion can be explained by this pathway.\nHowever, the literature on\nbiofilm biodegradation of alkaloids is limited, and *in vitro* studies have only\nfound minimal contributions by certain oral bacteria in isolation\n[@sunMetabolomicsEvaluation2016; @cogoVitroEvaluation2008]; it is possible that\na larger role is played by oral bacteria within larger, more metabolically active\ncommunities, e.g. biofilms [@takahashiOralMicrobiome2015].\n\n<!-- How this engineering will facilitate future research -->\n\n<!-- Forward-looking statements about the field as a whole -->\n\n<!-- a summary/importance of the engineering aspect of the work -->\n\n<!-- How it facilitates scientific research -->\n\n<!-- limitations of the platform show which questions would be unanswered -->\nTargeting individuals with moderate-to-large calculus deposits likely biased our\nsample, as the presence of calculus may increase the\nrisk of premature death\n[@yaussyCalculusSurvivorship2019]. Additionally, periodontal disease (often linked\nto the presence of calculus)\nis a risk-factor for respiratory diseases, if periodontal and respiratory\npathogens enter the bloodstream\n[@azarpazhoohSystematicReview2006; @scannapiecoRoleOral1999; @scannapiecoPotentialAssociations2001].\nIn our sample, the percentage of chronic maxillary sinusitis\n(37.0%)\nis lower than in another (more representative) male sample (44.1%)\n[@casnaUrbanizationRespiratory2021], and the caries percentage is similarly lower\nin our sample (17.6%) than\na more representative sample (22.9%) [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013].  \nWe used the presence/absence of a pipe notch and concurrent detection of tobacco\nas a crude estimate of the accuracy of the method, which we found to be around\n59.3%.\nThis is a very rough estimate, as the presence of a pipe notch is likely not a\nperfect indicator of whether or not someone consumed tobacco.\nDental calculus is also\nmore transient than for example bone, as it can become dislodged during life,\nintentionally or unintentionally, eliminating all trace of the alkaloids consumed\nprior to its removal.  \nFollowing burial, compound stability over\ntime will play a large role, as will microbial degradation of compounds by bacteria\nand fungi in soil [@liuNicotinedegradingMicroorganisms2015], as well as\nthe soil environment, such as temperature, pH, and oxygen availability\n[@mackiePreservationMetaproteome2017; @lindholstLongTerm2010].  \nDue to this, quantitation of the detected compounds may have limited value in\narchaeological samples due to degradation, and will greatly affect our correlations\nrelated to concentration.\nThe detected quantity of a compound will also depend on the quantity in dental\ncalculus during life, which is largely controlled by the quantity consumed,\nhow often the\ncalculus was disrupted/removed, metabolic breakdown of the compound, and inter-\nand intra-individual factors related to stages of biofilm maturation\n[@lustmannScanningElectron1976; @velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @zijngeBiofilmArchitecture2010].\nIn short, this means it is not really possible to equate the absence of a compound\nas evidence for the absence of consumption, which complicates\nthe interpretation of our results.\nWe have attempted to minimise errors occurring due to this limitation by including\na relatively large sample of individuals and replicating our analysis. Although,\ngiven the relatively low detection rate seen in tobacco, this remains a major\nlimitation, and will likely be compounded by increasing antiquity of the samples.\n\nFuture studies should explore how sampling from various types of teeth\nand their position in the mouth affects the probability of a compound becoming\nentrapped in dental calculus.\nThis may also be related to properties within the oral cavity, as well as chemical\nproperties of the compounds, which facilitate or reduce the incorporation-potential,\nand which incorporation pathways are more likely for a given compound.  \nWe only targeted drugs that were included in the forensic toxicological\nscreenings, and therefore only covered a limited number of the potential compounds\nthat could be of interest for exploring past diets and medicinal treatments. The\nlist of targeted compounds can be expanded as we discover more potential targets\nbased on which specific compounds/metabolites are more likely to be incorporated\nand preserved in dental calculus.  \nThere is an increasing interest in using oral fluid as a means of detecting alkaloids\nin living\nindividuals due to the non-invasive nature of the testing compared to blood\nand urine sampling [@coneSalivaTesting1993; @valenDetermination212017].\nThese *in vivo* studies are a valuable\nsource of method validation and can help determine the feasibility of detecting\ncertain alkaloids in oral fluid and, subsequently, dental calculus. Archaeologists,\nthough, will likely be responsible for exploring dental-calculus-specific\nincorporation and retention of alkaloids, as well as their long-term preservation\nin the burial environment. Finally, following our experience with salicylic acid,\nwe encourage all future studies to ensure that a control sample is taken from the\nsoil, either from the soil surrounding the individual, or, ideally, directly from\nthe skeletal remains. This should preferably happen before cleaning, but there will\noften be soil left over in cavities (e.g. nasal cavity, orbit, auditory meatus).\n\n<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->\n\n<!-- rephrase -->\nWhile a major limitation is the uncertainty surrounding whether or not a compound\nis actually absent, the power of the method lies\nin the ability to detect dietary and other compounds that were incorporated\nvia multiple\nconsumption pathways that are not detected by other methods.\nTaking\ntobacco consumption as an example; while pipe\nnotches are a useful way to identify tobacco consumption, pipe smoking was not the\nonly mode of tobacco consumption, with others including chewing, drinking, cigars,\nand snuff [@goodmanTobaccoHistory1994, p.67]. Pipe-smoking\nwas mainly practised by males [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013; @eerkensDentalCalculus2018],\nso methods like the one presented here\nare suitable for exploring tobacco consumption in an entire society, rather\nthan a trivial subset of past populations.<!--admittedly, our sample was just that...-->\nCombined with other methods, it can also give us a more complete picture\nof dietary patterns and medicinal/recreational plant-use in the past by capturing\nmultiple possible incorporation pathways of dietary (and other) compounds.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis preliminary study outlines the benefits of using calculus to target a\nvariety of compounds that could have been consumed as medicine or diet. \nThis method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be\nespecially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic\ndocumentation, such as rural communities, children and women.\nWe also\nshow that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward\nwith this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic research on\nthe consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration\nand preservation in dental calculus,\nin addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations on different parts\nof the dentition.\nAnother limitation of dental calculus as a medium is the inter- and intra-individual\nvariability of its formation and the many factors that can influence incorporation\nand retention of molecules and particles; however, in the absence\nof hair and serum (quite uncommon in archaeology), dental calculus represents\nan impressive long-term reservoir of information regarding the consumption of various\nalkaloids, whether dietary, medicinal, recreational, or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## References cited {.unnumbered}\n",
