Why does it grow on our teeth? Is it bad for us?\nWhy have archaeologists become endlessly fascinated by it? What is the point\nof this dissertation? Am I going to answer any of these questions?\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- The dissertation will be made widely available, so I want it to be as accessible as possible.\nThis is why the writing won't be particularly \"academic\" [**highly exagerated airquotes**]. That \nboring stuff is reserved for the articles -->\n\nDental calculus is becoming a popular substance in research on the behaviour and\nbiology of people in the past. You\nmay also know it as tartar or mineralised plaque. In other languages the word is\noften related to \"tooth stones\". In fact, calculus is itself latin for 'pebble'.\nThis was originally used as a term for mathematical calculations using counting\nstones, and only later used to describe various calcifications in the human body\n(<https://www.etymonline.com/word/calculus>). This can be the cause of some confusion,\nas calculus is also a branch of mathematics. If you see the term 'calculus' in\nthis dissertation, you can safely assume that I'm referring to stuff that grows\non your teeth and for which you receive lectures from your dentist, and not the\ntopic you dreaded in high school.\n\nI will briefly describe the formation of dental calculus here, but for a more\nthorough review of the entire process I refer you to [Chapter 2](#chap-background).\nDental calculus is formed from dental plaque, a substance that grows on your teeth\nand consists mainly of bacteria and\na surrounding structure called the extracellular matrix.\nWhen the local environment within and around the plaque reaches a favourable alkaline\npH, both the extracellular matrix and bacteria within will calcify\n[@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].\nThe alkaline pH causes minerals (especially calcium and phosphate)\nfrom saliva to enter the plaque, causing the extracellular matrix\nand eventually also the bacteria to harden, resulting in a concrete-like\ndeposit on the surface of the teeth.\nThe process repeats itself when new bacteria colonise the surface of the newly\nformed dental calculus, creating a layered structure, though somewhat disorganised\n[@jepsenCalculusRemoval2011; @akcaliDentalCalculus2018].\nDental plaque can accumulate more easily on teeth\n(and dental calculus) because they are a hard, non-shedding surface.\nMost of the surfaces in our mouth are covered by a layer of cells called the oral\nepithelium. These cells are continuously renewed as\nnew cells are formed and dead cells fall off [@squierOralMucosa1998].\nThis constant turnover means that it is difficult for\nbacteria to build the communities they require for producing biofilms. Enamel, the\nwhite substance that covers the crown of your teeth, behaves differently. It stops\ngrowing when the tooth has fully formed. After that, there is no renewal. This allows\nbacteria to continue to grow and develop communities if there is no intervention from\nyou (or your dentist)<!--cite-->. Dental plaque can trap a variety of different\nmicroparticles, including bacteria, human proteins, and small debris from the food\nwe eat\n[@hendyProteomicCalculus2018; @henryCalculusSyria2008; @delafuenteDNAHuman2013].\nWhen the plaque mineralises, it can preserve these microparticles over long periods\nof time, even after\nthe person whose teeth provided a home for the calculus has died.\nAlso, the main crystal structures in calculus strongly bind DNA, making\ncalculus a fantastic source of ancient DNA (aDNA) from the mouth [@warinnerNewEra2015].\nAnother advantage of dental calculus is that it represents a more recent and direct\nsource of diet than teeth or other bones. While bones and teeth can take years to\nremodel and incorporate a dietary signal, calculus forms on a much smaller\ntimescale and is in direct contact with the dietary material.\nCalculus can form within weeks at any point during an individual's life\nand may, therefore,\nindicate a recent and direct consumption of food, while bone can take years to\nshow a (indirect) dietary signal, following food molecules entering the\nbloodstream, and finally entering the bone from there.\nFurther, enamel stops forming after the crown of the\nlast tooth has developed---third molars, or 'wisdom teeth---at around 16 years of age,\nand the turnover of dentin is very limited [@hillsonDentalAnthropology1996].\nThese properties are probably why archaeologists have become increasingly\ninterested in dental calculus.\n\n## Dental calculus in archaeology {#intro-arch}\n\nThe main archaeological interest in dental calculus is to explore research questions\ninvolving diet and the evolution of the oral biome and oral health. To this end,\nit can contribute a surprising amount for such a small, seemingly insignificant\nmaterial. This relates to its ability to retain and preserve a wide variety\nof different materials, from the food we eat to the bacteria that make their home\nin our mouths\n[@yatesOralMicrobiome2021; @henryCalculusSyria2008; @warinnerPathogensHost2014; @warinnerEvidenceMilk2014; @adlerSequencingAncient2013].\nThe goal of current studies targeting archaeological dental calculus have not changed much\nsince the early uses of dental calculus in archaeological research, but the methods\ncertainly have, allowing us to unearth<!--pun always intended--> information\nthat was previously not considered possible.\nBy my count, archaeological dental calculus has now been subject to various forms\nof microscopy\n[@middletonOpalPhytoliths1994; @charlierSEMCalculus2010; @powerSynchrotronRadiationbased2022];\nextractions of biomolecules including DNA, proteins, and metabolites [@adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerEvidenceMilk2014];\nand stable isotope analyses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot of the number of articles per year in bioarchaeology and clinical dentistry with the term 'dental calculus' in the title.](01-intro_files/figure-html/fig-plot-and-wordclouds-1.png){#fig-plot-and-wordclouds width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerhaps the most common use of dental calculus is to recreate the diet\nof past people and populations ([@fig-plot-and-wordclouds]B).\nOne of the ways to do this is by dissolving the calculus in a weak acid or\ndecalcifant, or mechanically breaking it up. This process releases any fragments\nof plants that were trapped within the calculus and can be identified, for example\nwith a microscope. The tricky part is not destroying the plant fragments when\nreleasing them from the calculus.\nAs far as I can tell, the first attempt at this was the extraction of phytoliths\n(silicified plant remains) from the teeth of cows, sheep, and horses\n[@armitageExtractionIdentification1975].\nThis was a somewhat isolated use-case, and the method didn't really catch on until\nthe 1990s\n[@ciochonOpalPhytoliths1990; Middleton 1990, in @middletonOpalPhytoliths1994].\nThe first extractions from human teeth followed shortly [@foxPhytolithCalculus1996],\nand there are now studies using plant microremains\n(especially starch granules and phytoliths)\nfrom dental calculus to infer diet in past peoples from across the world,\nincluding Pacific Islands [@dudgeonDietGeography2014], China [@chenStarchGrains2021],\nEurope [@fiorinCombiningDental2021], and more\n[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @henryCalculusSyria2008; @mickleburghNewInsights2012].\nThe durable nature of dental calculus also means that microremains within it can\nsurvive for millennia, allowing us to look at the diets of early humans and other\nhominins\n[@pipernoStarchGrains2008; @henryCalculusSyria2008; @chenStarchGrains2021; @henryNeanderthalCalculus2014; @henryDietAustralopithecus2012; @buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hardyNeanderthalMedics2012; @hardyStarchGranules2009].\n\n\nThat bacteria can become trapped within calculus has been known to archaeologists\nfor a while [@brothwellDiggingBones1981<!--check-->; @vandermeerschMiddlePaleolithic1994], but it wasn't\nused in archaeological research until DNA extraction started to become more accessible\n[@delafuenteDNAHuman2013].\nDental calculus then became part of the third scientific revolution in archaeology.\nThe early studies focused on oral health in the past\n[@adlerSequencingAncient2013; @delafuenteDNAHuman2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014].\nBacteria have shorter lifespans than humans which makes them useful when studying\nthe evolution of bacteria in the human mouth\n[@delafuenteDNAHuman2013; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021].\nDiet has also been a focus of paleogenetic research. This has mainly been\naddressed by considering how long-term changes in the patterns of bacteria within\nthe mouths of our ancestors have changed that could be related to changes in diet.\nJust like we adapt to deal with various diseases, climates, etc., we also adapt to\nchanges in our diet\n[@adlerSequencingAncient2013; @yatesOralMicrobiome2021].\nDirectly identifying genetic\nmarkers of plants and animals within dental calculus is difficult, but not impossible\n(see @warinnerEvidenceMilk2014). Most of the\nDNA within dental calculus will be oral bacteria, and this will overwhelm the\nsmall signal from plant DNA, which makes species identifications problematic\n[@fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2022].\nA newer field of biomolecular archaeology, paleoproteomics, may be able to\naddress this issue by targeting plant proteins, along with a range of other\ndietary protein sources.\nHendy and coauthors were able to identify a number of these in dental calculus,\nas well as proteins from cereals, and milk proteins from\ndifferent sources [@hendyProteomicCalculus2018].\nDental calculus has also become a target for extracting other biomolecules that\nmay be related to diet, such as alkaloids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates\n[@velskoDentalCalculus2017; @gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].\nThe methods used for this\nhave also proven to be useful in detecting compounds that are related to other\nactivities and ceremonies, such as nicotine [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018], and may\nprovide some evidence of medicinal practices [@gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].\n\nTo a lesser extent, the presence and amount of dental calculus on teeth has been used\nas an indicator of dental health\n[@drewettExcavationOval1975; @sagneStudiesPeriodontal1977; @zhangDentalDisease1982; @lieverseDentalHealth2007].\n@pilloudOutliningDefinition2019\nexplored the terms associated with a number publications on dental or oral health,\ndental calculus came up as one of them; albeit not the most common, which was\n(unsurprisingly) dental caries (@fig-dental-terms).\n\nTo a lesser, lesser extent, it has also provided some interesting insights on\nnon-dietary activities, such as occupations and smoking habits. In a rare find,\nblue particles were detected in the dental calculus of a Medieval German woman.\nThese blue particles originated from lapis lazuli, an exotic stone\noften ground into pigments and used\nto illuminate manuscripts [@radiniMedievalWomen2019]. Nicotine was detected in dental\ncalculus of pre-colonisation individuals from California using Ultra-Performance Liquid\nChromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS), showing direct consumption of tobacco and\nproviding more detailed insights on the demographics of consumption in a way that no other\nhuman-adjacent archaeological materials can.\n\n![Word cloud of most common dental terms in articles. Figure is from @pilloudOutliningDefinition2019, Figure 1.](figures/wordcloud.png){#fig-dental-terms}\n\nIt wasn't always appreciated for the wealth of information hidden within its\nhardened shell.<!-- can't really blame them, most dental research is focused on its prevention and removal...-->\nUntil roughly 20 years ago, archaeologists who encountered calculus had limited\nuse for this material.\nSome researchers quantified it using a simple four-stage scoring method that was\ndeveloped for recording deposits\non archaeological dental calculus [@brothwellDiggingBones1981], similar\nto a common clinical scoring system [@greeneSimplifiedOral1964]. \nThe four-stage\nsystem is probably still the most widely used among archaeologists. More detailed\nmethods are also available [@dobneyMethodEvaluating1987; @greeneQuantifyingCalculus2005],\nbut the original method is generally preferred for its simplicity.\nUnfortunately,\nknowing the size of a calculus deposit is not as valuable as being able to\nanalyse the deposit itself, and the deposits were often\nremoved because they obscured tooth and root morphology [@scottBriefHistory2015].\nThis had made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move\n[@adamsRestaurantEnd2002, p.1]. Hindsight being what it is, it's hard to blame\nanyone. A lot of dental research mainly focuses on the prevention and removal\nof dental calculus.\n\nThe wide range of applications for dental calculus that we know about today,\nand the fact that it's pretty much ubiquitous in the\npast thanks to poor oral hygiene, makes it a really exciting target for future\n(and current) paleodietary research.\nThat being said, the study of dental calculus doesn't seem to fit into any predefined\nareas of study within (and beyond) archaeology. Most researchers seem to\nsee it as a means to the information contained within, rather than being worth studying\nin its own right. This can be problematic.\nOther than what we can see with our current methods, what do\nwe really know about dental calculus and how its growth and structure affect the\nreliability of these methods and potentially distort our interpretations of the past?\n\n## What is dental calculus? {#intro-what}\n\nTo answer these questions, we must first answer a single, surprisingly difficult\nquestion: What is dental\ncalculus? I'm not referring to its formation or composition, which I briefly\ndescribed [above](#chap-intro). How do we categorise it? Is it a dental disease? An oral\nhealth condition? A byproduct of oral conditions? We start by exploring various\ndefinitions of oral health. Definitions in an introduction\nare a little cliché and tedious, but often necessary<!--insert shrug emoji-->. Since oral health is a\ncomplex topic, definitions of oral health are often purposefully (and confusingly)\nbroad, and they extend beyond physical well-being and into the realms of emotional\nand social comfort.\nThe World Dental Federation (FDI) defines oral health as the ability to perform\nmouth- and face-related functions with confidence and without pain\n(including smiling, speaking, eating, etc.) [@fdiOralHealth]\n(<https://www.fdiworlddental.org/fdis-definition-oral-health>).\nBoth the World Health Organisation (WHO) and FDI take a similar approach to\ndefining oral conditions, giving a list of conditions that cause\ndiscomfort, pain, disfigurement, or death.\nThe list includes the dental conditions\ntooth decay (caries), gum disease (periodontal disease), and dental trauma, but\nnot dental calculus [@whoOralHealth]\n(<https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health>).\nWhile these are not likely to cause death, they are often the source of physical\nand emotional discomfort, and may cause further health complications if they are\nnot dealt with in a timely fashion.\n\nDental calculus and dental plaque are not\nconsidered oral conditions according to WHO. In fact, dental plaque is part of the normal\nfunctioning of our oral biome [@marshDentalPlaque2006]. When plaque reaches a certain\nlevel of acidity over a prolonged period of time, the normal functioning of the bacteria\nwithin the plaque may shift towards a disease-causing function.\nThe biofilm will cause the surface of the enamel to demineralise, eventually resulting\nin a cavity (or caries). Dental caries are unequivocally considered a dental disease.\nIf, instead, the biofilm calcifies, dental calculus is the result. Its status in oral\nhealth is questionable.\n\nDental calculus is not known to be painful, nor does it affect the ability to perform\nthe functions listed above. However, with continued accumulation, it may affect the\nconfidence of the person\nperforming these tasks [@collinsHomelessDental2007], and in extreme cases it can affect\nfunction [@balajiUnusualPresentation2019]. Most of the virulence and disease-causing\npotential is lost when the bacteria within dental plaque calcify [@akcaliDentalCalculus2018].\nIt has been shown to contain pockets of living bacteria that can be detrimental\nto oral and dental health [@tanCalculusUltrastructure2004; @tanBacterialViability2004].\nThe rough, porous surface of dental calculus is also\na great place for bacteria to attach more easily and develop a new layer of plaque on\nthe surface of the calculus. This is likely\nwhy there is often a correlation (NOT causation) between dental calculus and\nperiodontitis, especially subgingival calculus\n[@jepsenCalculusRemoval2011; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].\nSince it seems to fulfill some of the criteria of an oral condition, it should be\nconsidered as such, at least under the definitions provided by WHO and FDI.\nWhether or not dental calculus can be considered an oral disease is more\nquestionable.\nWhile it does grow on the surface of teeth, it doesn't seem to affect the underlying\nenamel. And while there is a relationship with periodontal disease\n(which has been defined as a dental disease), the nature of this\nrelationship is still under debate, with calculus likely being a secondary contributor\n[@jepsenCalculusRemoval2011]. As such, we can probably limit the definition to an oral\ncondition and not necessarily a dental disease [@pilloudOutliningDefinition2019].\nIn fact, dental calculus is quite hard, so a layer of dental calculus on a tooth can\nactually protect it from wearing down (although there are better options).\n\n## The study of dental calculus {#intro-study}\n\nIt seems that the researchers who are studying dental calculus approach it\nfrom a wide range of different fields and backgrounds, including genetics,\nproteomics, botany, and (bio)archaeology. The paleogeneticists mine it for the\nwealth of information it contains on oral health and disease in the past\n[@yatesOralMicrobiome2021; @warinnerPathogensHost2014].\nPaleodiet researchers extract microremains and residues from food\n[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @mickleburghNewInsights2012]\nto infer dietary practices. Bioarchaeologists use its presence and amount\nto broadly infer diet, and dental and overall health\nin a given population [@yaussyCalculusSurvivorship2019; @lieverseDentalHealth2007; @belcastroContinuityDiscontinuity2007; @novakDentalHealth2015; @slausDentalHealth2011]. <!-- need more examples. dental anthropologists? paleopathologists?-->\nThis leaves research output from studies of calculus scattered across\nmultiple venues, with no clear gathering point.\nI think it's fair to say that dental calculus should be included in\ndiscussions of pathological oral conditions, even if its role is secondary. But who\nis currently studying dental calculus as a substance in its own right? And why do we\nneed to learn more about it if we're just interested in what's inside?\nRelated discussions have started to take place in recent years\n[@radiniDirtyTeeth2022; @bucchiComparisonsMethods2019; @wrightAdvancingRefining2021].\n\nThe lack of a specific field of study for dental calculus to belong may be\nrelated to how it's taught to students (and if it's taught at all).\nTextbooks from the more established fields in bioarchaeology are probably\na good indicator of the teaching curricula, which also impacts research\nfocus.\nThe most popular osteoarchaeology textbooks only briefly mention dental\ncalculus as more of a footnote than anything else. A couple of lines describing\nwhat it is (usually 'mineralised plaque') and that it can contain food\ndebris and bacteria [@whiteBoneManual2005, @whiteHumanOsteology2011].\nThey're not wrong.\nDiseases that manifest themselves in the skeleton as lesions on the bones\nhave a very clear home in paleopathology. No one questions whether\nor not the degeneration of vertebrae from tuberculosis should\nbe included in the paleopathology textbooks (at least not as far as I'm aware).\n\nThese textbooks often include chapters on dental disease, where more detailed\ndescriptions of dental calculus are usually found\n[e.g. @robertsDentalDisease2007; @waldronPalaeopathology2020].\nDental caries, calculus' more famous sibling, will\noften get a few pages.\nIn some cases, dental calculus may even be hidden within a section on periodontal\ndisease or plaque\n[e.g. @ortnerIdentificationPathological2003; @aufderheidePaleopathology1998].\nThe focus of these (sub)sections is varied, with some simply describing what it is,\nand others giving\nbrief discussion on the relationship between calculus and periodontal disease.\nA more detailed section was dedicated to dental calculus in *Ortner's Identification\nof Pathological Conditions in Human Skeletal Remains*, with a detailed description\nof formation, structure, and application in (biomolecular) archaeology\n[@kinastonOrtnerDentition2019]. The description extends well beyond any\n(paleo)pathological significance of dental calculus.\nCan we fault the authors/editors for not\ngiving it more attention? After all, it's not a dental disease, and its relationship\nwith other dental diseases is unclear. What is clear, is that it has implications for\noral health, and, for that very reason, could be addressed more extensively in\npaleopathology; certainly in the textbooks that include dental disease.\n\n<!--Dental anthropology. -->\nOn the surface, dental anthropology seems like a more suitable home for\nthe study of dental calculus. However, it's not included in\n*A Companion to Dental Anthropology*, an otherwise great resource on\nstudying archaeological teeth.\nThe editors briefly acknowledge the valuable information\ngained from calculus and that it holds a lot of potential; but that's it\n[@scottBriefHistory2015].\nOther notable absences include textbooks such as\n*Technique and Application in Dental Anthropology* and\n*New Direction in Dental Anthropology* [@townsendDentalAnthropology2012],\nboth of which dedicate considerable attention to dental caries.\n<!-- Hillson, Dental Anthropology -->\nHillson's *Dental Anthropology*, a book that I consider to be\nthe 'bible' for dental anthropology, has a section on dental\ncalculus in the Dental Disease chapter.\nIt covers a basic description, the composition, microscopic structure,\nmethods used for recording archaeological calculus, and\nthe distribution in the dentition (i.e. which teeth are more prone to calculus buildup)\n[@hillsonDentalAnthropology1996].\nConsidering these are entire books devoted to the dentition, it seems odd that\nthere is often only a few paragraphs (if that) on dental calculus. Granted, the\nonly function teeth serve in the\ngrowth of dental calculus is as a suitable surface on which to attach;\nthough the role of substratum is an important role, as dental calculus is\nseemingly unable to form on other surfaces in the oral cavity.\n\n<!-- Sorry to do this to you again, but we need more definitions. -->\n<!-- The *Medical Dictionary for the Dental Professions (2012)* defines dental anthropology as: -->\n\n<!-- \"a branch of physical anthropology concerned with the origin, evolution, and development -->\n<!-- of dentition of primates, especially humans, and to the relationship between primates' -->\n<!-- dentition and their physical and social relationships.\" [in @irishIntroductionDental2015]. -->\n\n<!-- It could certainly be considered part of the development of dentition in primates -->\n<!-- (if you consider both 'development' and 'dentition' more broadly). Perhaps the -->\n<!-- description on -->\n<!-- the Dental Anthropology Association's (DAA) website gives more room for interpretation: -->\n\n<!-- \"Dental anthropology utilizes the dentitions of humans and other non-human primates--both past and present--to answer questions of anthropological interest. These questions can include (but are by no means limited to): How are individuals and populations related? What did their diet look like? How healthy were they?\" -->\n<!-- [@daaDentalAnthropology] -->\n<!-- (<http://www.dentalanthropology.org/>, accessed 30-Nov-2021). -->\n\n<!-- This description more directly addresses a dietary and health perspective, which -->\n<!-- certainly applies to dental calculus, as long as you consider it part of the dentition. -->\n<!-- It's possible we'll see dental calculus included in more detail in future textbooks, -->\n<!-- given how it has increased in popularity over the last decade or so. -->\n\nSince the use of dental calculus in biomolecular archaeology is relatively new,\nthere are fewer available textbooks, and it rarely has a dedicated course.\nThe most common place to find descriptions of dental calculus is, therefore,\njournal articles. There will be a short paragraph on dental calculus formation (and sometimes\ncomposition) in the introduction section. These are quite variable and are often limited\nby the word count of the journal. Despite this, the descriptions will often be as long,\nif not longer, than the sections in textbooks devoted to dental calculus\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019]. The focus of these paragraphs are generally the same.\nThey describe the formation and mineral composition of dental calculus, and provide some\nexamples of how dental calculus has been used in related studies (not unlike the beginning\nof this chapter).\nThe contribution of dental calculus to archaeology has been significant, so it\nis likely to receive more and more attention going forward. In fact, an entire\nchapter was recently devoted to dental calculus in the second edition of\n*Handbook of Archaeological Sciences* [@fagernasDentalCalculus2023]. Take that,\ndental caries!\n\n## The challenges of studying dental calculus\n\nWhat we know about dental calculus and the influence of diet was reviewed in an\narticle aimed at (bio)archaeologists. The overall conclusion reached in the article:\nit's still pretty unclear [@lieverseDietAetiology1999]. Now, 20-some years later,\nthere has been limited progress on this point.\nHigh-protein diets are linked to an increase of urea, which is linked to an increase\nin oral pH, which is linked to mineral deposition\n[@wongCalciumPhosphate2002; @dibdinOralUrea1998]. BUT, protein may also inhibit\ncrystalisation [@hidakaDietCalculus2007].\nStarch consumption has been linked to increased rates of caries in early farming\npopulations [@storeyPaleopathologyOrigins1986]. This is\nconsistent with *in vitro* testing, at least for starches high in amylose content<!--examples-->.\nSo a high-starch diet causes caries, not calculus, right? Well, starches with a high\namylopectin content are linked to increased calcification [@hidakaDietCalculus2007].\nIt likely depends on what is consumed along with the starch [@hidakaStarchRole2008].\nThere is also some (*in vitro*) evidence to suggest that silica may promote dental calculus\nformation by promoting mineral precipitation, i.e. the transfer of minerals from\nsaliva to the biofilm [@damenSilicicAcid1989]. Overall, this is an understudied\narea in both clinical and archaeological contexts.\n\n<!-- the mechanism of starch incorporation into dental calculus -->\nAnother aspect of diet and dental calculus where we are still looking for answers,\nis the process that causes fragments of food and other environmental materials\nto become entrapped in the dental calculus.\nWe know that it happens. Decades of research has shown dental calculus to be a\nseemingly unlimited resource for dietary substances. We don't know exactly how\nthis happens, and herein lies the potential for bias.\nEfforts have been made to understand\nhow much of the consumed food makes it into the calculus. These include studies\non modern humans [@leonardPlantMicroremains2015] and non-human primates\n[@powerChimpCalculus2015; @powerRepresentativenessDental2021],\nwhere food intake is meticulously documented, and calculus subsequently analysed.\nThese studies have common findings; the amount of the diet that becomes trapped\nin the dental calculus of any one person has no clear relationship to the amount\nof food that was consumed. The most likely reason is that the formation of dental\ncalculus differs between people [@powerChimpCalculus2015].\nSo, it's not a great way to study the diet of a single person, but generally suitable\nto study patterns in the diet of a population. The more people you study, the more\nlikely you are to gain a complete picture of the diet in a population.\n<!--kinda like the\nmore monkeys with typewriters you have, the more likely they are to reproduce\nShakespeare. This is not meant to be discouraging.-->\nThe fact that we can still see\n(in some cases, literally) remains that were consumed thousands of years ago is\npretty cool. We just need a better understanding of why the record of diet from\ndental calculus differs from the actual intake of food. This will allow us to make\nmore robust interpretations about past dietary practices.\nSomething that may influence the dietary record that we get from calculus is the\nmethod we use to extract the dietary remains from calculus.\nOur understanding of dental calculus extraction methods is improving, with studies looking\nat the effect of various acids used to dissolve calculus (commonly EDTA or HCl)\n[@trompEDTACalculus2017; @bucchiComparisonsMethods2019; @sotoCharacterizationDecontamination2019; @palmerComparingUse2021];\nas is our understanding of how the choice of tooth may affect our results\n[@fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2021], and that not all we see is related to\ndeliberate consumption [@delaneyMoreWhat2023].\n\nThese studies provide valuable insights into potential biases of our sampling methods\nand the representation of diet within dental calculus, with a minor caveat.\nMost of these studies have been conducted on living primates or archaeological\nremains. An issue with using living (or once living) organisms is the inability\nto control factors\nrelated to the variability between subjects. Basically, studying humans is messy\nand complicated because we're all unique. It's a lovely sentiment but it\ncan make for some messy science. Not bad science (not at all!). Just messy.\nA method of study that offers more control is the growth of\nplaque and calculus in a lab. This allows us to control many of the things that\nare difficult to control in humans, such as the bacteria that colonise our mouth,\nwhere each person has a pretty unique makeup of bacteria. We also have a very unique\ngenome (with the exception of identical twins) that plays a role in how quickly we form\ncalculus in our mouth (if at all). Certain enzymes start digesting our food as\nsoon as it enters our mouth, and the activity of these\nenzymes fluctuates throughout the day, causing a lot of variability both within and\nbetween individuals.<!--in response to meals, stress, etc.-->\nFinally, the number of microremains that enter our mouth over days, weeks, and\nmonths,\ncan be very different between people, even with the same diet.\nAll these things can muddy the results of research on living subjects, where a\nlab-grown approach can help tease out <!--the pesky--> confounding factors.\nI don't believe research conducted on lab-grown biofilms can in any way replace\nstudies with modern or archaeological individuals, nor should they. But it can\ncomplement these studies by zooming in on certain aspects that are too difficult to\nisolate in (once-)living people<!--expand justification-->.\n\nOften we can draw from clinical studies as there are common goals, e.g. discovering\nthe aetiology and/or presentation of a disease. However, the motivation driving the\nstudies in archaeology and dental research are inherently different; although,\nthere is certainly overlap in some areas ([@fig-plot-and-wordclouds]B and C).\nThere is more interest in preventing dental calculus from forming in the first\nplace, so most studies focus on short-duration models to explore anti-microbial\ntreatments and inhibition of biofilm formation and plaque buildup [@extercateAAA2010].\nAs shown in a previous study, calculus and plaque have distinct microbial profiles\n[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019], so the applicability of short-term models\nto explore archaeological questions on dental calculus are limited, since\nplaque is rarely (if ever) preserved. Archaeologists are more interested in\nquestions related to how diet influences the growth of biofilms, and how fragments\nbecome embedded inside, and what we can say about diet.\nFurther, the interest in dental calculus as a field of clinical research has been\ndeclining since the 2000s, which, as far as I'm aware, is when the last studies\ngrowing dental calculus in a lab were conducted. We can see this by the number of\nclinical articles with the term dental calculus in the title\n([@fig-plot-and-wordclouds]A). And they certainly aren't interested in how food\ndebris becomes trapped inside our calculus.\nDental calculus has also become less of a problem with the use of modern dental hygiene\npractices and regular visits to the dentist [@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019].\n\nTo summarise: Bioarchaeologists are interested in how dental calculus relates\nto dental and general health; paleodietary researchers are interested in the food\nremains that are trapped inside; paleogeneticists are interested in accessing the\noral bacteria that have been fossilised within; clinial dentistry views it as a\nnuisance to be removed and, ideally, prevented from forming in the first place.\nThis lack of systematic research specifically devoted to dental calculus as a substance,\nrather than a means to an end, leaves a lot of questions regarding the expected\nbehaviour of dental calculus and how information from the past becomes trapped inside.\nTo summarise the summary: we need to ask more basic questions about dental calculus.\n\n## Aims {#intro-aims}\n\nThis dissertation is a contribution to a dental-calculus-centric body of knowledge,\nand addresses a gap in the fundamental research on dental calculus to further our\nunderstanding of how we can use dental calculus to reconstruct the diets of people\nin the past. The main aim is the development, validation, and application of\na calcifying oral biofilm model to improve interpretations on archaeological dental\ncalculus. By developing a model system we can isolate the effects of confounding\nfactors in dental calculus and diet, and explore new uses for dental calculus\nin paleodietary reconstructions through fundamental experimentation. I also aim\nto assess the potential and limitations of dental calculus to explore dietary\nactivities of past populations.\n\nEvery decision we make, from sampling to statistical analysis, leads us down a\nunique path towards a different interpretation from the other possible paths in\nthe multiverse of analyses. It's important we fully understand the path we take,\nto ensure that it is the right path given the limitations,\nand one that maximises the validity and detail of our interpretations.\n\n<!-- In short, can I grow calculus in the lab? Is what I'm growing actually a substance -->\n<!-- that resembles calculus? And can the model be used to inform archaeological research; -->\n<!-- specifically, how should we interpret the food debris extracted from dental calculus? -->\n\nWith these aims, I hope to address the following research questions:\n<!-- objectives instead of questions? -->\n\n*How can we improve the resolution of our interpretations using dental calculus on individuals and populations?* <!--(overarching theme - problem statement needs to lead up to this)-->\nWe are stuck in the identification of compounds, and unable to speak to the\nquantity, since we know that it's not very representative of a single individual.\n\n*Can we trust the system? (i.e., using dental calculus to reconstruct diet)*\nSince we don't know the mechanism of incorporation, there are likely hidden biases\nand limitations of our methods as a result. We don't know the starting point, i.e.,\nexactly what and how much was originally trapped inside, so we have difficulty\nvalidating our methods.\n\n*How can a model improve our understanding of dietary reconstructions using dental calculus?*\nHow can it address current challenges in paleodietary reconstructions, and can it\nhelp us produce a better understanding of how dietary intake relates to the\nrecord of diet we extract from archaeological dental calculus?\n\n<!--This means sometimes asking the apparently obvious questions, like how does food become trapped in dental calculus.\nAnd occasionally you'll find that no one really has a good answer to these questions. (PREFACE?) -->\n\n\n## Thesis outline and structure\n\nIf you have made it to this point, you have probably read most of [**Chapter 1**](#chap-intro),\nin which I provide some context to the study of dental calculus in archaeology\nand identify some areas that could benefit from further investigation.\n[**Chapter 2**](#chap-background) provides some background information on oral biofilms\nand oral biofilm models in more detail than I can do in the research articles\nincluded in Chapters 3 and 4. So if you're already well-versed in oral\nmicrobiology, feel free to skip to Chapter 3. If not, I recommend picking\nup a textbook written by actual experts in the field of oral microbiology.\nIf, for some reason, you can't access one of these, feel free to read\n[**Chapter 2**](#chap-background). I suppose there are worse\noptions than something written by a PhD student in archaeology.\nThe chapter reflects the current knowledge of biofilms and the oral microbiome\n(as best I could summarise) at the time of writing, and no warranty is given for\nthe inevitable new developments that will change what we now believe to be true.\n\nTo address the aims of the dissertation outlined [above](#intro-aims),\nI developed a protocol to grow dental calculus in a lab on plastic tubes instead\nof looking at the real stuff you normally find inside your mouth. The reason\nfor using lab-grown biofilms instead of humans is that the *in vitro* lab model offers more\ncontrol over all the factors that go into the growth of dental calculus, at least\nin theory. The real world is messy, and sometimes you need to remove things from\nthe real world to break it down and really get into the nitty gritty of how it works.\nThere are many different kinds of biofilm models, including single species of bacteria,\nselect species\ndetermined by the researchers (defined consortium), and multiple species from some\nnatural source (the human mouth, for example). I will cover the different types of models\nin more detail in [**Chapter 2**](#background).\nSince there are many biofilm models to choose from, developing a new protocol may\nseem counter-productive; however, few are developed for long-term\ngrowth and even fewer with the purpose of mineralising the biofilm to form dental calculus.\nOne of the exceptions involves a highly complex\nsetup that is unlikely to be supported by budgets and facilities available to most\narchaeological laboratories [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].\n\nAfter developing a working protocol, the next step was to determine if the stuff\nI grew in the lab is actually\ndental calculus. Or at least something close enough that we can use\nit to explore our research questions.\nTo do this, we (myself and coauthors) determined the mineral\nand bacterial composition of our model using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)\nspectroscopy and metagenomic classification [**Chapter 3**](#byoc-valid).\nWe then compared the results of these analyses to naturally grown dental calculus,\nboth modern and archaeological.\n\nBeing confident that our model looks and behaves like human dental calculus,\nwe then set out to test some very basic behaviours of starch\ngrains within dental calculus.\n[**Chapter 4**](#byoc-starch) is a research article where we 'fed' the biofilm with\na known quantity of starch granules during the growth period to see if the input\nquantity/ratio matched the extracted quantity (or output). Those who are\nfamiliar with dental calculus research will not be surprised that it did not.\nThe more interesting outcome of the study is the more detailed explanation of how\nthe input and output starch quantities were mismatched.\n\n[**Chapter 5**](#mb11CalculusPilot) is a separate article, in the sense that it doesn't\ninvolve the biofilm model in any way. Rather, it addresses the theme of the overall\nutility of dental calculus in archaeological research.\nWe look at possible medicinal compounds in the dental\ncalculus of a Post-medieval Dutch population. We employed Ultra High Performance\nLiquid Chromatography coupled with tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) to identify\nvarious compounds in dental calculus, including alkaloids and other compounds.\nIt shows the potential of dental calculus to inform about past practices, but also\nhighlights some of the limitations we are currently experiencing in the field.\n[**Chapter 6**](#chap-discussion) is a discussion on the limitations and future potential of\ndental calculus in the field of archaeology, and what biofilm models can contribute to our\nunderstanding of past diet.\n\n## References cited {.unnumbered}\n",
