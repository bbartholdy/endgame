A chapter to discuss the limitations and potential of biofilm models
and calculus in archaeological research. And to reflect on the many,
many questions that arose during my research. In fact there were more
new questions that arose than were answered. Yay, science!

<!-- goal/summary of the dissertation -->
In this dissertation I have mainly focused on the development, validation, and
application of an oral biofilm model and its potential for informing
archaeological research. I have shown that it was possible to develop a
protocol for an oral biofilm model with a relatively simple setup, and
use it to grow model dental calculus, and also showed that it can serve
as a reasonable proxy to natural dental calculus (Chapter 3<!--insert hyperlink; and citation-->).
In Chapter 4 [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022] I demonstrated how the oral biofilm
model can answer questions and address hidden biases
related to using dental calculus for paleodietary reconstructions, specifically
using the identification and quantification of starch granules. Our results
showed that what goes in, doesn't necessarily come out. And the loss of information
is not evenly distributed across the different types of starches, depending on
size and morphology.
Chapter 5 is a study conducted on archaeological dental calculus. This is, after
all, a dissertation in archaeology. We analysed dental calculus samples from
a rural Dutch archaeological site in Middenbeemster, using ultra high performance
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). This allowed
us to identify a number of residues from plants that may have been consumed for
nutrition, medicine, or recreation.

## Dental calculus model

The goal of the model was to provide a relatively simple setup to explore fundamental
aspects of dental calculus and its application in paleodietary research.
