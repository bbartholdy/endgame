A chapter to discuss the limitations and potential of biofilm models
and calculus in archaeological research. And to reflect on the many,
many questions that arose during my research.

<!-- goal/summary of the dissertation -->
In this dissertation I have mainly focuses on the development, validation, and
application of an oral biofilm model and its potential for informing
archaeological research. I have shown that it was possible to develop a
protocol for an oral biofilm model with a relatively simple setup, and
use it to grow model dental calculus, and also showed that it can serve
as a reasonable proxy to natural dental calculus (Chapter 3<!--insert hyperlink; and citation-->).
In Chapter 4 [@bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022] I demonstrated how the oral biofilm
model can answer questions
related to using dental calculus for paleodietary reconstructions, specifically
using the identification and quantification of starch granules.
Chapter 5 ... archaeological calculus...

The goal of the model was to provide
