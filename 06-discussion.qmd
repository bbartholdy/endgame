## Summary

This is a chapter to discuss the limitations and potential of biofilm models
and calculus in archaeological research. And to reflect on the many,
many questions that arose during my research. In fact there were more
new questions that arose than were answered. Yay, science!
I will also reflect on the limitations and future potential of biofilm
models in archaeological research.

Models deviate from real life systems. Longer models must have more deviation.
They are also quite 'sterile' systems. After all, who can survive on sugar water
and raw starch grains twice a day? Not to mention that we would quickly become
dehydrated from drinking distilled or ultrapure water.

<!-- remind the reader why they suffered through the dissertation -->
Archaeological researchers are presented with a unique challenge.
Because time eventually degrades everything, the archaeological record will always
be incomplete. Barring the invention of time travel---and depending where you land
on the discussion of travelling back to a time before time travel is invented---we
are limited in our ability to fill in these gaps in our knowledge.

Consider it a puzzle that needs to be put back together, only some pieces are
permanently missing, and other pieces are broken.
Researchers will attempt to fill in the gaps (complete the puzzle) with interpretations
based on observations... 
To further complicate things, the methods we use may be biased<!--elaborate-->
causing additional pieces of the puzzle to go missing.
Some things cannot be validated on archaeological remains, since we are missing
key information about conditions in the past. Take for example dental calculus.
Archaeologists often use it to reconstruct the diet of past populations...



As shown in [Chapter 1](#fig-plot-and-wordclouds), dental calculus has become a
very popular substance within
archaeological research, to the point where it has surpassed its use in dental research,
at least in terms of articles where it is the main topic of focus. While the use of
oral biofilm models in dental research is well-established, even long-term calcifying
models to produce dental calculus, they never made it into archaeological research. At
least not to the extent that they were published.

There is also a lack of fundamental research and experimentation being conducted
within the fields that make use of archaeological dental calculus. There are of
course exceptions
[@powerRepresentativenessDental2021; @powerChimpCalculus2015; @leonardPlantMicroremains2015; @sotoCharacterizationDecontamination2019], but these have not addressed the full
extent of dental calculus limitations (nor should they).

the model outlined in this dissertation is in no way the ultimate solution to
save us from the limitations of the archaeological record, but may provide a
small step towards understanding them a little better, and hopefully promote
further exploration through fundamental research.


<!-- summary of the dissertation goals and outcomes -->

<!--

This disseration is a contribution to a dental-calculus-centric body of knowledge,
and addresses a gap in the fundamental research on dental calculus to further our
understanding of how we can use dental calculus to reconstruct diets in the past.
The main focus of my dissertation is the development, validation, and application of
an oral biofilm model to inform interpretations on archaeological dental calculus.
In short, can I grow calculus in the lab? Is what I'm growing actually a substance
that resembles calculus? And can the model be used to inform archaeological research;
specifically, how should we interpret the food debris extracted from dental calculus? 

Can an oral biofilm model provide useful insights on the mechanisms by which dietary components are
incorporated into dental calculus and the biases produced in this process?

Can an oral biofilm model address some of the limitations associated with using
dental calculus to reconstruct past diets?

Produce a better understanding of how dietary intake relates to the record
of diet from archaeological dental calculus.

Assess the potential of dental calculus to explore dietary and non-dietary
uses of plants in past populations.-->


<!-- how does this dissertation address the problems/aims stated earlier? -->

In this dissertation, I have mainly focused on the development, validation, and
application of an oral biofilm model and its potential for informing
archaeological research. I have shown that it was possible to develop a
protocol for an oral biofilm model with a relatively simple setup, and
use it to grow artificial dental calculus. I also showed that it can serve
as a reasonable proxy to natural dental calculus ([Chapter 3](#byoc-valid)<!-- citation-->).

The two articles that make up chapters 3 and 4 show some of the possible
contributions an oral biofilm model can make to the field of archaeological
research.



I demonstrated
how the oral biofilm model can answer questions and identify hidden biases
related to using dental calculus for paleodietary reconstructions, specifically
addressing the identification and quantification of starch granules. The results
from this study showed that what goes in, doesn't necessarily come out. And the
loss of information is not evenly distributed across the different types of
starches, depending on size and morphology [[Chapter 4](#byoc-starch); @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022].

In [Chapter 5](#mb11CalculusPilot) I present a study that goes beyond the model
and looks at
archaeological dental calculus. This is, after
all, a dissertation in archaeology. We analysed dental calculus samples from
a rural Dutch archaeological site in Middenbeemster, using ultra high performance
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). This allowed
us to identify a number of residues from plants that may have been consumed for
nutrition, medicine, recreation, or all of the above.


## The dental calculus model

The goal of developing a dental calculus model was to explore core aspects of
how we use dental calculus in paleodietary research, with a
relatively simple setup that is accessible to most labs in archaeological science.
The idea is
to take a step back and really scrutinise our current methods for interpreting
diet from dental calculus. What the field has accomplished so far is undeniably
impressive, but there are many things we still don't understand. Some of the things
we don't understand are on a very basic level, such as how plant microremains
become trapped inside calculus, how much of what we consume ends up inside
calculus, and whether our current methods are able to accurately extract that
information.

The model we chose was a simple model using a shaking incubator and a 24 deepwell
plate with the plastic lids as a substratum. The artificial saliva we used was
based on the basal modified medium used by Sissons and colleagues
[-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991; -@sissonsPHResponse1994; -@sissonsArtificialPlaque1997]
to grow dental calculus. We also made use of their calcifying solution, calcium phosphate
monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU). To make sure the calculus we were growing in the
lab was a good model for calculus grown naturally, we sequenced the DNA of our
model calculus and compared it to various sites inside the human mouth, including
dental plaque and calculus.
The bacterial composition of our model calculus samples had a strong oral signature,
but was distinct from other natural oral samples, including dental plaque and
calculus. The main difference between natural samples and model calculus was that
the natural samples were more heterogenous in composition. They had a larger number
and variety of microbes compared to the model calculus. This was also
reflected in the aerotolerance of dominant microbes in model calculus, which were
largely anaerobes, while natural samples had more aerobes and facultative anaerobes.
The natural samples also had a more diverese representation of bacteria from all
stages of biofilm development, including early- middle-, and late-colonisers, while
model calculus samples were predominantly late-colonisers
[[Chapter 3](#byoc-valid); @bartholdyAssessingValidity2023].

Our metagenomics results were similar to a comparable *in vitro* biofilm model.
In the study, the authors also used a 24-well plate with pooled saliva as inoculate.
The growth medium was similar but also contained a sheep's-blood serum, and the
samples were only grown for 24 hours [@edlundUncoveringComplex2018]. As with our
model, the comparison with natural oral samples showed a lower overall richness
and diversity, and a distinct microbial profile
[[Chapter 3](#byoc-valid); @bartholdyAssessingValidity2023]. Given that our results
are similar to a short-term biofilm model, we may be replacing the medium too
frequently (every three days), and not allowing communities to establish more
complex metabolic pathways present in mature biofilms.


We also used Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to ... the mineral
content of our model, and also compare that to natural
dental calculus, both modern and archaeological.
Our analysis using FTIR spectroscopy showed that our biofilm model, after 25 days
of growth, produced a substance that is chemically very similar to both modern and
archaeological calculus. The crystallinity of the model calculus also matched the
archaeological sample we used as a comparison, though with a slightly less ordered
structure. This may be related to the age differences in model calculus compared
to archaeological calculus. Not only did the archaeological calculus spend a few
hundred years maturing in the ground, allowing crystals to expand into the
gaps created by degraded organic matter [@weinerBiologicalMaterials2010], but
given the known lack of oral hygiene practices in the past, the calculus was likely
older than 25 days before being buried<!--dental health in MB citation-->.
We also only analysed a single archaeological sample, so we don't know how
representative this sample is of archaeological samples in general. Perhaps this
was a particularly under- or over-mineralised sample. It would be more appropriate
to compare to the modern reference samples, since we are actually trying to
recreate something that mimics natural modern calculus, not something that has
been buried for hundreds of years or more. Unfortunately we didn't have access
to new modern samples and couldn't produce modern calculus grind curves for this
analysis.

It is interesting that the mineral composition was so similar to natural calculus
given the unique microbial profile. It suggests that the mineralisation occurs
if conditions are favourable, regardless of the microbial profile. Even in the
absence of known mineraliser, *Corynebacterium matruchotii*. Since FTIR
only addresses the overall mineral composition, we will need to further investigate
whether there are any other structural/chemical differences between our model
and natural calculus that may be caused by microbial profiles.


Further refining the protocol can be a solution to this.
Using serum in the medium to establish thicker and more stable biofilms, allowing
slow-growing organisms to become more established [@ammannZurichBiofilm2012].
Filter-sterilising the heat-sensitive solutions that are not autoclaved, such as
CPMU and starch solutions, may
prevent environmental contamination from entering the biofilm during the
setup, such as members of the *Enterococcus* genus. While these are commonly
present in oral samples,

Changes to the model setup will have to be re-validated, as the concentrations
of nutrients, let alone the type of nutrients, will impact the community composition
of the biofilms [@edlundBiofilmModel2013].

Further validation... physiological response to changing conditions. For example,
after carbohydrates have been consumed, there is a dip in the pH within the oral
cavity as the carbohydrates are consumed by bacteria, which release acidic
by-products. This occurs within the first few hours of consuming carbohydrates,
after which the saliva will work to balance the pH back to pre-carbohydrate
levels, also known as the 'Stephan curve' [@stephanStudiesChanges1947].
By acting as a buffer and restoring the oral pH-level, saliva can help prevent
high levels of acid from demineralising the tooth surface and causing caries.
Since our model is fed both with sucrose and starch, it is important to know
that the pH levels don't permanently drop to levels that are unfavourable to mineral
supersaturation and plaque mineralisation.

After establishing that our model dental calculus mimics, at least to some extent,
the real deal, we assessed what biases may occur in starch incorporation. Put simply,
we added a
known amount of starch granules---well, to the extent we could estimate the large
quantities in our starch solutions without counting every single granule---to our
biofilm over the course of the 25-day experiment. Then we dissolved the calculus
and counted the number of starches that that were inside. Those who are familiar
with previous dietary research on archaeological dental calculus will probably
not be surprised that the number of starches we extracted was nowhere near the
amount we put in. More interestingly, though, the size of the starch granules
influenced the outcome; fewer large starches were extracted than what was put
in<!--rephrase-->. This could be related to how starch granules are trapped in
biofilms in the first place, where size and/or surface morphology of the starch
granules can influence the likelihood of being retained in the biofilm.

It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes
[@adamsLifeUniverse2002], so we also included wheat starches in the model to
cover a wider range of granule shapes and sizes.


### Model limitations {#disc-model-limitations}

<!-- Limitations of this and other biofilm models -->
So far I have covered what our biofilm model can do. It is equally important to talk
about what our model can't do. <!-- We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty! -- Douglas Adams -->

While we have a high degree of control and reproducibility, especially when compared to
*in vivo* models, there are certain conditions we cannot regulate. This includes environmental
conditions such as CO~2~ and oxygen availability, which rely on the conditions in the lab where
the experiments take place.<!-- Bacteria are able to create favourable conditions within the biofilm (cite).-->
We also lack the ability to control salivary flow rates and circadian rhythms, both of which
can influence the growth of plaque.
It also includes the final microbial composition of the calculus. We use whole saliva as
the inoculate, so the microbial profiles of the biofilms may change depending on the saliva
donors and even on the time of day that the saliva was collected<!--citation-->.

The very isolated and controlled model setup also deviates from the conditions in someones
mouth. Many of the natural predators of the biofilm are not present. Plaque is constantly
at risk of dislodgement by the tongue, salivary flow, and toothbrushing and other oral hygiene.

As shown in a previous study, calculus and plaque have distinct microbial profiles
[@velskoMicrobialDifferences2019], so the applicability of short-term models
to explore archaeological questions on dental calculus are limited, since
plaque is rarely (if ever) preserved.

A well-known limitation of biofilm models is the difficulty in capturing the
diversity and complexity of the natural oral biome. Diversity and complexity may
be represented as interspecies communities and complex metabolic dependencies between
organisms within the communitues, or as an environmental complexity determined by
nutrient availability, host immune-responses to biofilms, and fluctuating
microenvironments across the biofilm in response to these factors
[@edlundUncoveringComplex2018; @bjarnsholtVivoBiofilm2013]. These limitations
can be overcome by complex experimental setups, but at the cost of lower throughput
and increased financial cost.

Increasing the number of species included in a model can approach the diversity found
in the natural microbiome, but still falls short of capturing the complete diversity [@edlundBiofilmModel2013].

### Biofilm model applications in archaeology
<!-- future directions and potential of the biofilm model for archaeological research -->
<!-- move to end of chapter? -->

Biofilm models are an untapped resource in archaeological research, especially
for dental calculus research. Coupled with existing methods for validating
..., the proverbial sky is the limit.
The potential applications for this model, and others like it, are endless. Figuratively speaking.

<!--How it can improve our understanding of the mechanism by which dietary compounds become trapped in dental calculus?-->

<!-- Recovering dietary and other information from dental calculus 
 - we struggle a bit to explain what we are seeing
-->

<!-- Calculus research potential in the future, dietary and otherwise -->

<!-- What needs to be done going forward -->

One of the questions produced during the analysis of dental calculus in chap 5.
was, how did these molecules ultimately become trapped in the calculus? Based on
the presence of many metabolites, it seems that this may not have been during consumption,
but rather during excretion through saliva, i.e. when the molecules are on their
way out of the body again. This makes some sense, since food actually spends relatively
little time in our mouth, and significantly longer in our body. This may also explain
the very low retention of starch granules we found in Chapter 4. It seems that most
of the starch granules are swallowed, while few become lodged in our teeth/plaque and are
eventually trapped in dental calculus. Without looking into the mechanism by which
starches and other food molecules are incorporated into dental plaque, we are 
always going to be guessing what is going on archaeologically.

An important question to address is what role bacteria play in the incorporation
and retention of dietary microremains, and whether differing bacterial profiles

The absence of host salivary $\alpha$-amylase activity in our model
(as shown in @bartholdyInvestigatingBiases2022) provides
an opportunity to explore the effect of various amylase levels on the incorporation
of dietary compounds, especially starches, in dental calculus. However, the
absence in our current study may have affected the microbial composition of our
biofilms.
Our model has no renewable source for $\alpha$-amylase once the inoculations
have been completed. There are streptococcal species present in the model that
are known for their ability to bind amylase
[@nikitkovaStarchBiofilms2013; @haaseComparativeGenomics2017];
however, we did not investigate whether the strains present in our
model contain these genes.
Starch solutions were only introduced on day 9 of the experiment. Prior to this,
all samples were treated with the sucrose solution. The absence of starch during
inoculation could have suppressed bacterial production of amylase-binding proteins
[@nikitkovaEffectStarch2012].
Frequent medium replacements may also be clearing out all of the unbound host salivary
amylase.
<!-- need to bridge this last sentence -->
Exogenous $\alpha$-amylase can be added to the model and explored
as a controlled variable.


## How dental calculus can inform past activities

Dental calculus has provided unique perspectives on multiple [aspects of] humans in
the past, from diet to the evolution of the oral microbiome. Researchers continue
to find innovative ways to extract information from a material that was once
discarded.

### Limitations to address

Many studies have already pointed out the limitations in our current methods 
using dental calculus to inform past diet. Ancient DNA is limited
by the low amount of diet-related genetic material in dental calculus compared
to an overwhelming number of host-associated genomes related to the millions of
microbes inhabiting the oral cavity. Further complicating the matter is the
inability to assign damaged DNA sequences to a single precise origin, and instead
relying on low resolution estimates and making interpretations based on context
[@mannHaveSomething2020].

Identifying and quantifying plant microremains has a particular set of challenges.
Humans have become reliant on processing foods to aid digestion and to maximise
the energy acquired from eating. Unfortunately, this also means that the
microremains are put through various damaging processes during preparation
[@graneroStarchTaphonomy2020]. Pre-cooking processing
may already render starch granules unidentifiable [@liInfluenceGrinding2020].
During cooking, starch
granules are, at best, modified and, at worst, completely destroyed depending on
the cooking method [@henryCookingStarch2009]. The granules that survive the cooking
process are then submitted to further harm in the oral cavity by the act of chewing
and the presence of digestive enzymes. After death, the starch granules that are
trapped in dental calculus will have to resist degradation from the burial
environment, including bacteria, funghi, and water damage [@graneroStarchTaphonomy2020].
To add final insult to injury, further damage can occur during excavation
and processing of the dental calculus [@trompEDTACalculus2017], and even during
preparation for microscopic identification [@graneroStarchTaphonomy2020].
Through all this, there are still dietary molecules and microremains that somehow
survive hundreds-to-thousands of years inside dental calculus, and remain identifiable.

To take things a step further, it's not enough to identify the problems, but rather
to identify the <!--.....[cause, source, implications? of the problem? ]...........-->

To date, most experimental methods have addressed the damage and modifications
occurring to microremains present on tools and cooking utensils
[@maMorphologicalChanges2019; @liInfluenceGrinding2020; @langejansRemainsDay2010],
and not in the context of dental calculus. Given the added processes affecting
the survival and morphology of microremains unique to the oral cavity, this context
is very important.

Perhaps the main limitation that needs to be addressed is our lack of understanding
of incorporation pathways. How can we possibly expect to understand diet from
archaeological dental calculus if we don't understand fundamental processes that
lead to dietary components ending up in dental calculus in the first place?
Understanding to what extent the processes within the oral cavity cause damage
to or completely eliminate the dietary compounds is also an area we have little
prior experimentation to draw on.

Validation conducted on archaeological remains will suffer from the same limitations
as *in vivo* studies; the variability of dental calculus growth, both between
two or more individuals, but also between dental calculus deposits within the
oral cavity of a single individual. The human oral cavity is home to many unique
environments causing differences in the chemical and bacterial makeup of dental
calculus [@hayashizakiSiteSpecific2008; @fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2022].
Our best option to control these many factors and explore the precise nature of
their individual impact on dietary ... in dental calculus, is to conduct controlled
experiments in a lab....

The presence of a variety of molecules detected by mass spectrometry is also
a big question mark. We know that the stability of molecules plays a role in
what will ultimately be detectable by mass spectrometry. The chances of finding
principal pharmacologically active or psychoactive constituents of plants, such
as morphine or tetrahydrocannabinol, are relatively slim since these molecules are
unstable and have a hard enough time surviving decades, let alone (pre-)historic
timescales [@lindholstLongTerm2010].
In addition, these molecules may also be present as contamination in labs or
in the burial environment. I cannot stress enough how important it is to collect
control samples from surrounding soil (found this out the hard way) and to replicate
findings.
It is also important to consider the potential incorporation pathways. If someone
was chewing tobacco or storing coca in their cheeks, the most likely place to
detect nicotine or cocaine, the principal alkaloids of these plants, would be
in dental calculus deposits on the molars. The mucous-rich nature of saliva
that is produced by the parotid glands (located in the cheeks) also makes it
preferentially bind toxins [@doddsHealthBenefits2005].
<!-- molecules more likely excreted through serum-rich saliva?? -->
Another consideration is the presence of molecules in dental calculus as a result
of excretion from the body through the saliva. If you consider the amount of time
you spend with food (or other things) in your mouth. It is relatively short. A few minutes at most?
Whereas the time spent in your body is much longer, as food molucules enter the bloodstream
and are distributed throughout the body <!-- lately I've been reading the Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body to my son-->.
The molecules can then re-enter the mouth through the saliva and spend significantly
more time in the mouth second time around. At this point the orignal compounds
will have been broken down by, for example, the liver, and only the metabolites
may be present. The plausibility of finding moelcules via this pathway depends
on the size of the molecules and the ability to diffuse from serum/plasma to
saliva and enter the oral cavity<!--rephrase and elaborate-->.
This also means, unfortunately, that it wouldn't be possible to determine the
mode of consumption (e.g. chewing vs. smoking) based on the mass spectrometric
results alone, but would also require analysis of the dentition to identify
tooth staining and periodontal disease<!--citation that smoking causes discol Watts and Addy 2001 -->.


Dental calculus is a hard, mineralised material. It can clearly provide good
protection to the microremains and various molecules trapped inside, and survive
thousands of years<!--Neanderthal or other hominid calculus-->. It is, however,
not impenetrable. In fact, it's a porous material<!--cite-->. This means that
it is important to consider what may have been originally trapped within the
calculus, and what could have entered post-mortem.
In the study from chapter 5, we extracted various compounds from dental
calculus using UHPLC-MS/MS, including salicylic acid, a phytohormone from willow
trees (**Salix alba**, for example) with medicinal properties. Willow bark
has long been known for its medicinal properties, and is present in many common
foods, and it is therefore not surprising that we found it in the dental calculus
of people from the 19th century. We also know, however, that salicylic acid is
abundant and very mobile in soil. With this in mind, how do we interpret our
findings? There are currently no standards for authenticating results from
GC/LC-MS/MS analyses on archaeological samples. Ancient DNA uses, among other things,
damage patterns from the sequences to determine whether a sequence is old or not,
and there are many tools available to accomplish this, such as decontam,
PMD tools, HOPS amd cuperdec<!--citations-->.
We attempted to provide a method to authenticate our finds by plotting the
quantity of compounds in three washes and comparing these quantities with the
quantity extracted from the calculus itself. We expect to see a decrease in
quantities over the three washes as surface contaminants are removed, and a
susequent increase in quantity as the calculus is dissolved and the compounds
that were embedded within the calculus are extracted [@bartholdyMultiproxyAnalysis2023].
This assumes that the embedded compounds were incorporated during life.
We also included modern synthetic compounds that we know would not have been
present in the past. These included MDMA, ...
We detected cocaine in ......X....... individuals. While not a modern compound,
since it has been used for millinea in the Americas
[@indriatiCocaPrehistoric2001; @springfieldCocaineMetabolites1993; @abucaCocaTrade2019],
it didn't become known to Europeans until the
colonisation and was only widely adopted in the late 19th century [@abucaCocaTrade2019].
This complicated things. While we wouldn't expect to see cocaine in a rural
population from 19th century Netherlands, it wasn't impossible to imagine the
presence of coca leaves (cocaine was first isolated from coca leaves in 1860).
Given the possible impact of such a finding, we analysed new samples from the
same individuals in a separate lab on different equipment. We were unable to
detect cocaine in any of the replicated individuals [@bartholdyMultiproxyAnalysis2023].
Upon further research, we were unable to find historic evidence of coca leaf-use
in Europe, and the only small-scale botanical imports were recorded prior to the
late 19th century (the most recent individuals in our study were buried in the 1860s).


<!-- For example, it has been shown
that small hydrophilic metabolites are disproportionately
lost from dental calculus compared to larger, more hydro-
phobic metabolites (Velsko et al. 2017). This suggests that
some movement of water through the calculus deposits
does occur (Mann et al. 2018). -->

It has been shown that dental calculus preserves well, and that little external
contamination enters the calculus after burial [@warinnerPathogensHost2014]<!--check citation-->.

So what does this mean for our interpretations? Well, until we can find a way
to separate external contamination from authentic compounds from the past,
and quantify the extent of external contamination in dental calculus, say with
some sort of experiment burying model calculus for a period of time, we can
say that they most likely consumed plants containing salicylic acid, but that
we also cannot rule out contamination as the source. Most likely it's a combination
of both.

<!-- Advantages over bone - and limitations 

Contains more DNA than bone (Mann et al. 2018)
-->

One way to explore the external contamination of calculus and how it may affect
already present compounds and microremains, is to set up an experiment where
model calculus samples containing known quantities of compounds (and controls without anything)
are buried for different periods of time (within a reasonable timeframe).
We originally attempted this, but the model calculus protocol was not ready
and the model calculus samples were not sufficiently mineralised to survive in
the ground. The initial biofilm growth and burial are included in a blog post
(https://www.leidenarchaeologyblog.nl/articles/spit-tartar-and-burial-an-experiments-diary),
but no further results were written up because of the aforementioned issue with
the protocol. This particular failure motivated me to revise the protocol and properly
validate the grown model dental calculus [see [Chapter 3](03-article1.qmd) and @bartholdyAssessingValidity2023].


### Future perspectives

Need more fundamental research specifically in the context of diet and dental
calculus using a variety of techniques, including biofilm models, ethnographic
research, and experimental archaeology.
