  abstract = {This work presents a study of elemental composition and preponderant structure of human dental calculus, as they mature in the mouth for a period of 1 year. The synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence technique using a white beam was employed as an analytical method. The set of samples were extracted from different dental elements of the same subject, who did not require any other clinical care. By means of analyzing the Ca/P molar ratio an estimation of the main crystallographic structure was attained, by simple comparison with stoichiometric values of the several crystalline structures that compose the calculus. The results showed a slowly progressive transformation of the initial crystalline structures (brushite) into more stable structures (hydroxyapatite), passing through octacalcium phosphate and whitlockite. The concentrations of mayor components (Ca and P) as a function of time followed a sigmoid curve. The analysis of trace element concentratios versus time indicated a null or small correlation of concentration values with the kinetics of the crystallization process. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The importance of commensal microbes for human health is increasingly recognized, yet the impacts of evolutionary changes in human diet and culture on commensal microbiota remain almost unknown. Two of the greatest dietary shifts in human evolution involved the adoption of carbohydrate-rich Neolithic (farming) diets (beginning approximately 10,000 years before the present) and the more recent advent of industrially processed flour and sugar (in approximately 1850). Here, we show that calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) on ancient teeth preserves a detailed genetic record throughout this period. Data from 34 early European skeletons indicate that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming shifted the oral microbial community to a disease-associated configuration. The composition of oral microbiota remained unexpectedly constant between Neolithic and medieval times, after which (the now ubiquitous) cariogenic bacteria became dominant, apparently during the Industrial Revolution. Modern oral microbiotic ecosystems are markedly less diverse than historic populations, which might be contributing to chronic oral (and other) disease in postindustrial lifestyles.},

The development of dental calculus is a dynamic process that starts with a nonmineralized biofilm which eventually calcifies. Nonmineralized dental biofilm entraps particles from the oral cavity, including large amounts of oral bacteria, human proteins, viruses and food remnants, and preserves their DNA. The process of mineralization involves metabolic activities of the bacterial colonies and strengthens the attachment of nonmineralized biofilms to the tooth surface. From a clinical point of view, dental calculus always harbors a living, nonmineralized biofilm, jeopardizing the integrity of the dento-gingival or implanto-mucosal unit. This narrative review presents a brief historical overview of dental calculus formation and its clinical relevance in modern periodontal practice.},

However, current laboratory procedures may affect the recovery of microremains and this issue has not been thoroughly investigated. This study involved the analysis of dental calculus from five Chalcolithic individuals from El Mirador cave (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) from a methodological perspective. Two sample processing protocols published in the archeological literature were used for this purpose, and results were compared to the El Mirador archaeobotanical record published elsewhere. Analyzed as a whole, the microremains found in the dental calculus samples are consistent with a population immersed in a farming economy, although they are not representative of the richness of the archaeobotanical record of the site. Furthermore, the two protocols delivered different results, in terms of the number of microremains identified, the time required for analysis, and associated contamination problems. This data indicates that the method selected may affect the results. We recommend further research using a larger sample set to fully understand how methodological factors affect the preservation and observation of microremains embedded in dental calculus. We also call for a discussion on the role of dental calculus in archeological research.},

The extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of raw material preparation through chewing.},

Recent discoveries of a host of archaeological sites dating to the proto-Shang culture (4000\textendash 3600~cal BP) have helped elucidate the transition to the Shang culture. Nevertheless, there are few investigations about the mode of subsistence and economy of the proto-Shang culture, and how this might have shaped the transition to statehood. In this present study, we analyzed the starch grains preserved in dental calculus and teeth surfaces from 16 samples from the site of Nancheng in order to gain a better understanding of the subsistence strategy and plant consumption of proto-Shang people. We also performed experiments to test how different cooking methods may lead to size changes in the starches of four Poaceae plants, in order to identify the processing methods used by the proto-Shang people. The results indicate that Triticum aestivum, Coix lacryma-jobi, Setaria italica and some yet-unidentified roots and tubers were consumed by these individuals. These data indicate a broader spectrum of plant consumption than that seen by previous archaeobotanical and stable isotope analyses. Such a broad spectrum of plant consumption provided a substantial economic base for proto-Shang people and might be one of the factors supporting the subsequent development of the Shang state culture.},

By measuring the decrease in Ca2+ concentration (by means of ion-selective electrodes), we determined both spontaneous precipitation and seeded crystal growth from solutions that contained 1 mmol/L calcium, 7.5 mmol/L phosphate, 50 mmol/L Hepes pH 7.2, and various amounts of silicic acid. Polymerized silicic acid, but not its monomer, was found both to cause a 60\% reduction in the lag period that precedes spontaneous precipitation and to enhance the growth rate of seeded hydroxyapatite crystals. Silica suspensions showed effects similar to those of polysilicic acid. In all cases, the precipitated material was found to be hydroxyapatite. Whereas seeded brushite crystals grew slowly without silicic acid, hydroxyapatite was the only mineral detected after crystal growth in the presence of silicic acid. Apparently, polysilicic acid acted as a substrate for hydroxyapatite nucleation, inducing secondary nuclei on both hydroxyapatite and brushite crystals. The finding that polysilicic acid could overcome part of the inhibitory effect of a phosphoprotein on calcium phosphate precipitation gave additional support for the idea that polysilicic acid and silica may promote the formation of dental calculus.},

Calculus was extracted from 114 teeth representing 104 unique individuals from a late 16th to early 18th century skeletal series on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) to address questions of human\textendash environment interactions and possible dietary preference. Scanning electron microscopy was used in lieu of optical microscopy for its superior depth of field and resolution of surface detail. The calculus microfossil recovery produced 16,377 total biogenic silica microfossils: 4733 phytoliths and 11,644 diatoms. The majority of phytoliths correspond with the Arecaceae or palm family (n = 4,456) and the minority corresponds to the Poaceae or grass family (n = 277). Because of the relatively large sample size, we were able to test hypotheses related to age cohort, sex, dental element and geographic region. Results indicate no significant difference in phytolith or diatom recovery based on age cohort or sex. The high frequency and proportion of Arecaceae phytoliths found in calculus extracted from the anterior dentition suggests consumption of soft or cooked foods containing palm phytoliths and the high frequency of diatoms recovered from the southern part of the island argue for different sources of drinking water.

These factors affect the microbial community composition and distribution of species in dental plaque, but it is not known how well these patterns are reflected in archaeological dental calculus. In most archaeological studies, a single sample of dental calculus is studied per individual and is assumed to represent the entire oral cavity. However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500-5000 BP). Inter-individual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intra-individual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples may be of environmental origin, showing the importance of including environmental controls or several lines of biomolecular evidence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {This study presents the results of complementary isotopic and dental calculus analyses of a number of individuals buried in two cemeteries of Roman and medieval chronology in Lamon, northern Italy. Eleven individuals from the Roman cemetery of San Donato and six from the medieval cemetery of San Pietro are presented and discussed. The results suggest a distinctive stability of the two populations, with most of the analysed individuals showing a local or regional origin. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes are indicative of a diet based on a mixed C3/C4 plant consumption and rich in animal proteins, with no significant difference between the Roman and the medieval populations. The consumption of C4 plants, more resilient to the Alpine climate, is consistently documented both by isotopes and dental calculus. Dental calculus results permit the characterisation of the typology of the crop consumed, namely millet, barley/wheat and legumes and may also suggest differing cooking processes between the Roman and the medieval periods. Phytoliths, vascular elements, fungal spores and animal remains from dental calculus provide new insights into the diet of the analysed individuals but also, hypothetically, into possible medicinal treatments. The presence of birds such as fowls and ducks in the medieval diet of some individuals from San Pietro has also emerged. Overall, the results of this study open a new window into the biographies of the individuals analysed, their diet, mobility, habits, and environment, thus stimulating further and more systematic investigation on the populations occupying an Alpine sector which is still poorly understood from an archaeological perspective.},

Phytoliths were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their siliceous nature was confirmed by X-ray microanalysis. The phytoliths were compared to those of soil samples from both the areas of the tombs corresponding to the abdomen and the periphery of the skeletons, and were classified taxonomically by comparison with a large collection of silica particles from modern plants in the Mediterranean area. Most of the phytoliths identified on the enamel and the dental calculus belong to the family of Poaceae, while the phytoliths from the abdominal area belong to Poaceae, Leguminosae, Cyperaceae, and Chenopodiaceae. Results are concordant with archaeological, ecological, and historical data from the same site, and with the human Mediterranean diet. If done properly, the study of phytoliths can provide direct information about the vegetable diet of past human populations, and could be applied to the study of human fossils. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Delayed-onset infection is defined as infectious swelling and trismus accompanied by pain or the presence of suppuration starting approximately 30 days after surgery. This study aimed to describe the occurrence and potential predisposing factors of delayed-onset infection. A retrospective case-control study of 223 lower third molar surgeries was performed. Participants were selected from among 1102 outpatients who underwent surgery between January 2013 and June 2018 at Semmelweis University. The inclusion criterion for the case group was inflammation of the operated area after suture removal. Patients in the control group were healthy nonsmokers {$<$}26 years old who healed without complication. Statistical analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact test. Complications occurred only in patients {$<$}26 years old approximately 29.5 days after surgery. A significantly higher risk was observed for younger age, total soft tissue coverage, deeper impaction, lower Nolla stage (P {$<$} .001), mesioangular direction (P = .002), and full bone coverage (P {$<$} .05). Distal space was inversely correlated with complications (P {$<$} .001). Lower Nolla stage, total soft tissue coverage, lack of distal space, deeper impaction, or mesioangular tilt may promote delayed-onset infection. Follow-up of at-risk patients and the maintenance of oral hygiene are recommended. To investigate the effect of mogroside, palatinose, erythritol, and xylitol on the dental plaque pH of children and to compare the plaque pH change between caries-active and caries-free children caused by these sweeteners. Thirty-six children (mean age 6.2 {$\pm$} 2.9-year-old), caries-active and caries-free, were included. After refraining from practicing oral hygiene, the accessible plaque was collected and equally divided for challenging with 6 different solutions: mogroside, palatinose, erythritol, xylitol, 10\% sucrose, and deionized water. The pH of each solution was measured using a digital pH meter at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. Mogroside, erythritol, xylitol, and water did not significantly lower the dental plaque pH, however, palatinose reduced dental plaque pH comparable to sucrose (p {$<$} 0.05). Comparing the caries-active and caries-free groups, only sucrose produced significantly different pH value at min 5 and 10. Mogroside, erythritol, and xylitol did not lower the dental plaque pH in caries-active or caries-free children. However, palatinose affected the dental plaque pH similar to sucrose.},

We present the results of a study, in which sequential thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) were combined with morphological analysis of plant microfossils, to identify material entrapped in dental calculus from five Neanderthal individuals from the north Spanish site of El Sidr\'on. Our results provide the first molecular evidence for inhalation of wood-fire smoke and bitumen or oil shale and ingestion of a range of cooked plant foods. We also offer the first evidence for the use of medicinal plants by a Neanderthal individual. The varied use of plants that we have identified suggests that the Neanderthal occupants of El Sidr\'on had a sophisticated knowledge of their natural surroundings which included the ability to select and use certain plants.},

Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein {$\beta$}-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (eighth century BC to nineteenth century AD) in England, as well as 14 dental calculus samples from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterize the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detect proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. This study demonstrates that proteomic approaches can robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are typically under-represented due to their poor macroscopic preservation.},

  abstract = {One of the most important challenges in anthropology is understanding the disappearance of Neanderthals. Previous research suggests that Neanderthals had a narrower diet than early modern humans, in part because they lacked various social and technological advances that lead to greater dietary variety, such as a sexual division of labor and the use of complex projectile weapons. The wider diet of early modern humans would have provided more calories and nutrients, increasing fertility, decreasing mortality and supporting large population sizes, allowing them to out-compete Neanderthals. However, this model for Neanderthal dietary behavior is based on analysis of animal remains, stable isotopes, and other methods that provide evidence only of animal food in the diet. This model does not take into account the potential role of plant food. Here we present results from the first broad comparison of plant foods in the diets of Neanderthals and early modern humans from several populations in Europe, the Near East, and Africa. Our data comes from the analysis of plant microremains (starch grains and phytoliths) in dental calculus and on stone tools. Our results suggest that both species consumed a similarly wide array of plant foods, including foods that are often considered low-ranked, like underground storage organs and grass seeds. Plants were consumed across the entire range of individuals and sites we examined, and none of the expected predictors of variation (species, geographic region, or associated stone tool technology) had a strong influence on the number of plant species consumed. Our data suggest that Neanderthal dietary ecology was more complex than previously thought. This implies that the relationship between Neanderthal technology, social behavior, and food acquisition strategies must be better explored.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of food components, such as starch, soybean flour, fish meal, rapeseed oil, and coconut oil, on calcium phosphate precipitation were studied using a pH drop method. RESULTS: Although the addition of starch had no effect on the rate of precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), it increased both the rate of transformation of ACP to hydroxyapatite (HAP) and the induction time (i.e. time for the initiation of transformation of ACP to HAP to occur); this was irrespective of the heat treatment of the starch. Amylopectin (insoluble constituent of starch) was effective in increasing the rate of HAP transformation, but amylose (soluble constituent of starch) was not. Oil specimen obtained from rapeseed (400 microl ml(-1)) increased the entire reaction of calcium phosphate precipitation, but that from coconut did not. Protein food, such as soybean flour and fish meal, decreased the rate of transformation of ACP to HAP and increased the induction time, while they had no effect on the rate of ACP precipitation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that carbohydrate and oil (both are staple diets for the humans) enhance oral calcification (dental calculus formation or re-mineralization of tooth enamel), while side dishes of protein food would decrease it.},

Analysis of these microscopic plant remains has increased in popularity in recent years, providing information on diet that complements dental microwear and stable isotope studies. However, it is unclear how accurately these microremains reflect plant consumption. This study examines how well starch granules and phytoliths in dental calculus from a living population (the Twe) with a well-documented diet capture the range and intensity of plant consumption. We find that plant microremains are a poor predictor of plant consumption on an individual level, but may provide a good signal of plant consumption across a population, as well as evidence for plant processing in the mouth. This is the first study to test how well plant microremains in dental calculus reflect plant consumption in a population with a known diet. Results from this project have implications for interpreting plant microremain data from archaeological dental calculus samples.},

  abstract = {Dental plaque is a structurally- and functionally-organized biofilm. Plaque forms in an ordered way and has a diverse microbial composition that, in health, remains relatively stable over time (microbial homeostasis). The predominant species from diseased sites are different from those found in healthy sites, although the putative pathogens can often be detected in low numbers at normal sites. In dental caries, there is a shift toward community dominance by acidogenic and acidtolerating species such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, although other species with relevant traits may be involved. Strategies to control caries could include inhibition of biofilm development (e.g. prevention of attachment of cariogenic bacteria, manipulation of cell signaling mechanisms, delivery of effective antimicrobials, etc.), or enhancement of the host defenses. Additionally, these more conventional approaches could be augmented by interference with the factors that enable the cariogenic bacteria to escape from the normal homeostatic mechanisms that restrict their growth in plaque and out compete the organisms associated with health. Evidence suggests that regular conditions of low pH in plaque select for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Therefore, the suppression of sugar catabolism and acid production by the use of metabolic inhibitors and nonfermentable artificial sweeteners in snacks, or the stimulation of saliva flow, could assist in the maintenance of homeostasis in plaque. Arguments will be presented that an appreciation of ecological principles will enable a more holistic approach to be taken in caries control.},

Recent research has targeted the plant microremains preserved in this mineralised deposit as a source of dietary and health information for recent and past populations. However, it is unclear to what extent we can interpret behaviour from microremains. Few studies to date have directly compared the microremain record from dental calculus to dietary records, and none with long-term observation dietary records, thus limiting how we can interpret diet, food acquisition and behaviour. Here we present a high-resolution analysis of calculus microremains from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We test microremain assemblages against more than two decades of field behavioural observations to establish the ability of calculus to capture the composition of diet. Our results show that some microremain classes accumulate as long-lived dietary markers. Phytolith abundance in calculus can reflect the proportions of plants in the diet, yet this pattern is not true for starches. We also report microremains can record information about other dietary behaviours, such as the age of weaning and learned food processing techniques like nut-cracking.},

The dental calculus of contemporary human and non-human populations with known diets have been used as reference datasets, including the chimpanzees of Ta\"i National Park (C\^ote d'Ivoire), but explaining the preservation mechanism involved is challenged by our incomplete knowledge of the microremain content within the diets of these reference populations and our rudimentary information on microremain incorporation into dental calculus. Here, we analyse phytoliths in faecal samples to assess to what extent plant phytoliths of a diet are reflected in the dental calculus as well as in the egested faeces. In this study, we identify and document the faecal phytolith assemblages as an indicator of plant consumption in two Western chimpanzees of the Ta\"i National Park (C\^ote d'Ivoire) before (wet season), during (dry season) and after (dry season) a dust-rich period. Moreover, observational dietary records of these two individuals were compiled to improve the interpretability of this dental calculus phytolith dataset. The faecal phytolith assemblages vary significantly across samples in terms of abundance and diversity. The most common phytolith morphotypes were eudicot plates, single-cell and multi-cell tracheids, monocot rugulose and echinate spheroids and, to a lesser extent, unspecified thick and thin elongates. High loads of grit and other micro-remains (e.g. diatoms) are found during the dry period. Using observational dietary records as a starting point and our faecal results as a terminus, we consider how dental calculus can accumulate phytoliths. Our findings enable identification of the phytolith morphotypes that are under-represented in dental calculus, which is highly informative for future dental calculus research strategies.},

The majority of recent research has focused on the retrieval of plant microfossils embedded in its matrix and interpretation of these finds as largely the result of deliberate consumption of plant-derived food. However, while most of the material described in published works does represent food, dental calculus is in fact a "depositional environment" as material can enter the mouth from a range of sources. In this respect, it therefore represents an archaeological deposit that can also contain extensive non-dietary debris. This can comprise a wide variety of cultural and environmental material which reaches the mouth and can become embedded in dental calculus through alternative pathways. Here, we explore the human behaviors and activities besides eating that can generate a flux of particles into the human mouth, the broad range of additional cultural and environmental information that can be obtained through the analysis and contextualisation of this material, and the implications of the additional pathways by which material can become embedded in dental calculus.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the viability of bacteria within these areas. Methods: Supragingival calculus harvested from patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis was immediately frozen to \textendash 70\textdegree C. Six samples were cryosectioned, stained with a bacterial viability kit, and examined with fluorescence microscopy. Controls comprised heat treatment of cryosections prior to staining. Four additional samples were stained and examined whole a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Nine additional samples were prepared for bacterial culture, after initial irradiation with ultraviolet light to kill viable organisms on the covering plaque layer. Test samples were crushed to expose internal bacteria, while two controls were used without crushing. Results: Viable bacteria, as identified using the bacterial viability stain, were found within cavities/lacunae in supragingival calculus cryosections. Similar results were obtained from whole calculus samples using CLSM. Of the nine experimental samples where bacterial culture was attempted, five provided positive bacterial culture under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; one showed positive growth under aerobic conditions only; while one showed no bacterial growth. The controls showed no bacterial growth. Conclusions: From this study, it appears that viable aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be present within supragingival calculus, specifically within the internal channels and lacunae. Clinically, this may be important, since incomplete removal of supragingival calculus may expose these reservoirs of possible pathogenic bacteria and be a factor in the recurrence of periodontal diseases after treatment.

Aim: To investigate the ultrastructure of non-decalcified young and mature supragingival calculus and subgingival calculus, and the possible presence of internal viable bacteria. Materials and methods: Supragingival calculus was harvested from five patients, 9\textendash 10 weeks after scaling and root debridement. Five samples of mature supragingival and subgingival calculus were taken from patients presenting with adult periodontitis. Specimens were fixed and embedded for transmission electron microscopy. Results: The ultrastructure of young and mature supragingival calculus was similar with various large and small crystal types. Non-mineralised channels were observed extending into the calculus, often joining extensive lacunae, both containing intact non-mineralised coccoid and rod-shaped microorganisms. Subgingival calculus possessed more uniform mineralisation without non-mineralised channels and lacunae. Conclusion: Supragingival calculus contains non-mineralised areas which contain bacteria and other debris. The viability of the bacteria, and their identification could not be determined in this preliminary investigation. As viable bacteria within these lacunae may provide a source of re-infection, further work needs to be done to identify the bacteria in the lacunae, and to determine their viability.},

Dental calculus is a mineralised biofilm that forms on the surface of teeth, with the potential to encase anything that comes into contact with the mouth. Dental calculus has provided information on the lifeways of past people including diet, health, disease, trade and fabrication. To extract this microarchaeological information from dental calculus it must first be processed, either mechanically (with a mortar and pestle) or chemically (generally with hydrochloric acid or HCl), in order to free the microparticles and biomolecular structures encased within. Until now, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has not been used for microparticle extraction. Here we present data that demonstrate EDTA is an equally and potentially more effective decalcifying agent for extracting microparticles than previous methods using samples from the Southwest Pacific and Ireland. EDTA has the added benefit of being an appropriate for the first step in genomic and proteomic sample processing.},

Dental calculus does not typically accumulate as much today as historically, and clinical oral microbiome research studies focus primarily on living dental plaque biofilm. However, plaque and calculus reflect different conditions of the oral biofilm, and the differences in microbial characteristics between the sample types have not yet been systematically explored. Here, we compare the microbial profiles of modern dental plaque, modern dental calculus, and historic dental calculus to establish expected differences between these substrates. Results: Metagenomic data was generated from modern and historic calculus samples, and dental plaque metagenomic data was downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project. Microbial composition and functional profile were assessed. Metaproteomic data was obtained from a subset of historic calculus samples. Comparisons between microbial, protein, and metabolomic profiles revealed distinct taxonomic and metabolic functional profiles between plaque, modern calculus, and historic calculus, but not between calculus collected from healthy teeth and periodontal disease-affected teeth. Species co-exclusion was related to biofilm environment. Proteomic profiling revealed that healthy tooth samples contain low levels of bacterial virulence proteins and a robust innate immune response. Correlations between proteomic and metabolomic profiles suggest co-preservation of bacterial lipid membranes and membrane-associated proteins. Conclusions: Overall, we find that there are systematic microbial differences between plaque and calculus related to biofilm physiology, and recognizing these differences is important for accurate data interpretation in studies comparing dental plaque and calculus.},

  abstract = {Milk is a major food of global economic importance, and its consumption is regarded as a classic example of gene-culture evolution. Humans have exploited animal milk as a food resource for at least 8500 years, but the origins, spread, and scale of dairying remain poorly understood. Indirect lines of evidence, such as lipid isotopic ratios of pottery residues, faunal mortality profiles, and lactase persistence allele frequencies, provide a partial picture of this process; however, in order to understand how, where, and when humans consumed milk products, it is necessary to link evidence of consumption directly to individuals and their dairy livestock. Here we report the first direct evidence of milk consumption, the whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), preserved in human dental calculus from the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE) to the present day. Using protein tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BLG is a species-specific biomarker of dairy consumption, and we identify individuals consuming cattle, sheep, and goat milk products in the archaeological record. We then apply this method to human dental calculus from Greenland's medieval Norse colonies, and report a decline of this biomarker leading up to the abandonment of the Norse Greenland colonies in the 15(th) century CE.},

  abstract = {The objectives were to develop and characterize a procedure based on a ureolytic pH rise to deposit calcium phosphate into microcosm dental plaque biofilms and to test the importance of the plaque pH range. Plaque biofilms were cultured in a multiplaque culture system (`artificial mouth') with a continuous supply of a simulated oral fluid (basal medium mucin; BMM) with 146mmol/l (5\% w/v) sucrose periodically applied over 6min every 8h. After initial plaque growth, the biofilms were periodically exposed for up to 16 days to 6-min applications of calcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing 20mmol/l CaCl2, 12mmol/l NaH2PO4, 5mmol/l monofluorophosphate and 500mmol/l urea (pH 5.0). Three application regimes were examined, one included a sucrose-induced acidic pH fluctuation. Plaque hydrolysis of the urea in CPMU caused the pH to rise to between 8.2 and 8.8, depositing fluoridated and carbonated calcium phosphates, and possibly some calcium carbonate, into the plaque. Calcium, phosphate and fluoride deposition was rapid for about 4 days and then slowed. After 10 days' treatment under standard conditions (BMM containing 1mmol/l urea and 1mmol/l arginine), plaque calcium and phosphate concentrations had increased up to 50-fold and 10-fold to approximately 2\textendash 4 and 1\textendash 2mmol/g plaque protein, respectively. The calcium, phosphate and fluoride content increased steadily. Calcium phosphate deposition was proportional to the plaque resting pH, increasing over four-fold when the BMM urea concentration was increased from 0 to 20mmol/l, which raised the resting pH from 6.4 to 7.2 and yielded a mean plaque calcium concentration of 14.3mmol/g protein, one subsample reaching 20.8mmol/g protein. Supplementation of BMM with 20\% human serum inhibited deposition. These results support the hypothesis that an alkaline pH in plaque is critical in promoting plaque mineralization and that mineral deposition is modulated by serum. These factors are likely to be important in regulating calculus formation.},

It contains a multitude of diverse biomolecules, providing information about an individual's culture, diet, ancestry, and health. Most researchers who study archaeological dental calculus use genomic or proteomic approaches, although a wide range of other techniques are now available. However, few studies have utilized efficient multiomic protocols. This lack of integration is problematic, as such approaches in other fields have proven to improve results and strengthen interpretations. Our review discusses three multiomic approaches: (1) interactions between the metaproteome and metagenome; (2) relationships between the host genome and oral metagenome; and, (3) associations between the epigenome and metagenome. We draw from multiomic studies on soil, plant, gut, and modern oral microbiomes to demonstrate how such integration can provide insights that are not attainable with single-omic approaches.},

  abstract = {The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health, and disease, but little is known about the global diversity, variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting that they have been important oral members since before the catarrhine\textendash platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100 thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial coadaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic modern humans that is not observed in later modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal framework for understanding microbial health and disease.},

  abstract = {Objectives Dental plaque is associated with a variety of systemic diseases and mortality risks in living populations. However, bioarchaeologists have not fully investigated the mortality risks associated with plaque (or its mineralized form, calculus) in the past. This study examines the relationship between survivorship and calculus in a medieval skeletal sample. Materials and methods Our sample (n = 1,098) from four medieval London cemeteries, c. 1000\textendash 1540 CE, includes people who died under attritional (normal) and catastrophic (famine and plague) conditions. The associations between age and the presence of dental calculus on the permanent left first mandibular molar are assessed using binary logistic regression and Kaplan\textendash Meier survival analysis. Results The regression results indicate a significant negative relationship between age and calculus presence for individuals of all ages who died under normal mortality conditions and for adults who died under both normal and catastrophic conditions. Survival analysis reveals decreased survivorship for people of all ages with calculus under normal mortality conditions. Similarly, during conditions of catastrophic mortality, adult males with calculus suffered reduced survivorship compared to males without it, though there was no difference in survivorship between adult females with and without calculus. Conclusions These results suggest that, as in modern populations, calculus accumulation in the inhabitants of medieval London reflects a greater risk of premature death. The evaluation of calculus, a potential measure of underlying frailty, in the context of a demographic measure of general health suggests that it might provide insights into health in past populations.},
