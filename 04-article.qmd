# Summary

We used the BYOC model to try and look at how starch granules are incorporated
into dental calculus. We 'fed' the biofilm with a known quantity of starch granules
during the growth period. Preliminary results suggest that a very small proportion
of consumed starch is retained by the calculus. The size of starch granules also
influences the likelihood of retention, with larger granules less likely to be
trapped in the calculus.
