# Curriculum Vitae {-}

I obtained my BSc (honours) in archaeology with a concentration in physical 
anthropology at the University of Calgary in 2015. My thesis was supervised 
by Dr. Mary Anne Katzenberg and explored the application of micro-CT in 
archaeological examination of osteoarthritis lesions in the vertebrae of 
unprovenanced skeletal remains. I went on to get my MSc in Osteoarchaeology at
Leiden University in 2017. Here, my thesis research was supervised by Dr. Andrea
Waters-Rist, where I looked for relationships between enamel properties and dental 
disease in the deciduous dentition, using micro-CT. The materials used for this
research were from a 19th century Dutch population.

I started my PhD position in 2017, under the supervision of Dr. Amanda Henry. 
The main focus of the research involved developing and validating a protocol 
to develop a model dental calculus system, which could be used to explore 
dietary research questions from an archaeological perspective. The protocol was
validated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to assess the 
mineral composition, and metagenomic analysis to characterise the microbiome.
The protocol was then applied to explore dietary questions ...

Alongside my PhD research, I participated in a variety of activities both related
and completely unrelated to my dissertation research. I helped develop and 
co-instructed the Quantitative Methods in Archaeology course for two consequetive
years. I co-supervised multiple Master's students in the MSc Osteoarchaeology
specialisation.
I also taught a number of guest lectures on dental calculus, dental diseases, 
statistics, and open science. I was a teaching assistant in the Osteoarchaeology 
course for third year Bachelor's. I received my Data Carpentry teaching certification
and co-instructed multiple Data Carpentry workshops teaching the R Statistical 
Programming language to social scientists,
co-hosted by Leiden University, TU Delft, Erasmus University Rotterdam, and
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

After my PhD contract ended, I took a job as a Data Steward at TU Delft, at the
faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering. In this role I provide
support and training for researchers on research data management and Open Science.

Organised a workshop on dental non-metrics
