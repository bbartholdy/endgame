This is my PhD dissertation. It is written with the
[**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) 
package, and is hosted by GitHub and Netlify.

I am currently experimenting with a (semi-)continuous-deployment-type
release of my dissertation, meaning I will be releasing chapter drafts
as they are ready. Since these are drafts, they are subject to change
when they are reviewed by the committee (or if I decide to make changes).

You can follow the progress [here](https://bjorn-endgame.netlify.app).
