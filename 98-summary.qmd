<!-- Dental calculus -->

Dental calculus. This small, hard, inconspicuous substance that forms on the of
teeth humans and animals contains a surprising amount of information about our
lives. During formation and growth as a living plaque biofilm, it tends to
accumulate a wide variety of very small objects, especially bacteria and food
debris, from various sources. 
These sources and
the particles they leave behind in our mouth are influenced by activities and
biological processes that are unique to us, such as our dietary preferences,
oral hygiene practices, genetics, and the environment in which we live.
<!-- archaeological dental calculus -->
What makes it so interesting to archaeologists is that, following mineralisation,
these particles become trapped and
well-protected against removal and degradation during hundreds to thousands of
years in the ground, preserving a picture of the activities performed by its
human host. This picture can be unlocked by archaeologists by extracting and
identifying proteins from plants and animals, and genetic material and microremains
from plants that were trapped inside the calculus matrix.
<!-- Problem formulation -->
The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many
major problems is that this picture was never a complete picture of a lifetime of
activities. Another problem is that it has faded over the years, and some parts of
picture have been completely erased. There are many things influencing what gets
trapped inside dental calculus, what gets preserved for all those years until it
can be analysed, and how much of that information we can extract and interpret.
<!-- research questions -->
We know that these problems exist. We know that they limit our interpretations of
past activities. We need to approach these problems more systematically at a
fundamental level. 

We need to find out more
about what exactly is causing external particles to become trapped inside our
dental calculus, and be able to quantify exactly how they impact our interpretations
of dietary practices from archaeological dental calculus.

My dissertation introduces a potential method for resolving these issues, namely
a protocol for growing artificial dental calculus in a lab. Working with a very
controlled model of dental calculus in a lab allows me
to explore the influence of a wide range of factors that may influence the uptake
of particles into dental calculus, and what biases are introduced by these factors
as well as the methods we currently use to extract information from archaeological
dental calculus. Addressing these fundamental issues and limitations will go a
long way towards improving the resolution of our interpretations of past dietary
activities. I also explore new ways to extract information from archaeological
dental calculus to learn more about our past.

<!-- summary of dissertation chapters -->
**Chapter 1** is a brief introduction into the many uses of
archaeological dental calculus to reconstruct the diet of past populations.
I also outline the current state of dental calculus research, and some of the
problems we are facing. I only briefly describe what dental calculus is, and
how it is formed; this is an important concept to understand, since it influences
the uptake of food particles, and is influenced by diet. **Chapter 2** provides
more detail on the formation and growth of dental plaque, and mineralisation
to form dental calculus. Here, I also provide an overview of oral biofilm models
to provide some context for the experiments I conducted in my dissertation research
using an oral biofilm model

**Chapter 3** is the first article, which introduces
the oral biofilm model I developed for my research. In this article we also
assess the ability of our model to mimic the properties of natural dental calculus
in order to justify using model calculus as a proxy for archaeological dental
calculus. By characterising the bacteria present in the model calculus,
<!-- elaborate on method - sequencing the DNA and identifying species abundances-->
we found
that it was indicative of an oral microbiome, though somewhat distinct from the
natural calculus we used as a comparison. We also determined the mineral content
using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which established that the
model was primarily made up of carbonate hydroxyapatite, the predominant mineral
in natural dental calculus. The second article that forms **Chapter 4** we applied
the calculus model to find out what happens when we add a known amount of
dietary starch granules to model calculus during formation, and attempt to extract
the starches using a common method for extraction of starches from archaeological
dental calculus. We were able to validate what previous studies on modern humans
and non-human primates have shown, that the quantity of starches that we extract
from calculus, is not very representative of the dietary intake.
We also discovered that one of the causes for this misrepresentation of the starch
record is that large starch granules were being incorporated at a lower rate
than smaller granules. This was demonstrated by the fact that potato granules,
which are quite a bit larger than wheat, were underrepresented in our extracted
counts.

In addition to diving into the causes behind dental calculus limitations, we also
sought out to find novel uses for archaeological dental calculus. In **Chapter 5**,
the final article in this dissertation, we used a novel method employing
ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(UHPLC-MS/MS) to identify various plant-based alkaloids traditionally used
for medication and non-dietary activities, such as nicotine, opioids, and
cannabinoids.
We were unable to detect opioids and cannabinoids, but
we found evidence of alkaloids and metabolites derived from the consumption of
tea and/or coffee, as well as nicotine (and its metabolite, cotinine), and
salicylic acid, the primary phytohormone in willow bark. 
 We combined these results with the presence of skeletal and dental
indicators of disease to find patterns of potential disease management.
We were unable to
definitively link the presence of these with evidence of disease to justify
medicinal activities, but we found some interesting correlations between
maxillary sinusitis and markers of tobacco-use and consumption of tea and coffee.

In the final part of the dissertation, **Chapter 6**, I discuss the outcomes of
the studies from previous chapters, addressing the oral biofilm model and its
implications for archaeological research. I lay out the challenges we need to
accept to further our understanding of archaeological dental calculus and how it
relates to the dietary activities of the people we study in the past. This includes
systematically conducting more fundamental research to understand the mechanisms
causing various dietary (and non-dietary) markers to become entrapped in dental
calculus.
