# Supplementary information {.unnumbered}

This dissertation contains a lot of supplementary materials. Therefore
none of it is included in the dissertation itself. I will instead provide
links to the online material, which will be useful unless you are
reading a physical copy. You could type out the entire link or you
could just go read the online version. However, if you are reading a physical copy it means
you are special enough to have received one. What's much less
likely is that you have borrowed one of the copies of this very
niche PhD dissertation from the library. In this case, why? But
also, just go to the online version.

Most of the materials can be found on the Open Science Framework [(DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/3YX8M)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3YX8M).

The oral biofilm model protocols are published on protocols.io [(DOI: 10.17504/protocols.io.dm6gpj9rdgzp/v1)](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.dm6gpj9rdgzp/v1).
