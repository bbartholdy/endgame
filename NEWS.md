Revisions made based on supervisor feedback.

Main changes made:

- Update citation entries in Zotero to fix in-text citations where there were discrepancies in how authors
were entered, resulting in the generated in-text citations thinking identical authors
were different.
- Issue with chapter 4 article (sections rendering as chapters) fixed.
- No major changes to the actual content

All modifications to content can be seen in commit https://github.com/bbartholdy/endgame/commit/851c7f1ee4a8827f8ae4092ad7ce727be13acf19
