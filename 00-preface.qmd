This is not your traditional dissertation, which was a conscious choice
on my part. Sort of. First of all, it's not very common for a dissertation
in my faculty to have a preface, which is why I have prefaced this preface
with an explanation for why I need a preface.

When I started my PhD research I had no intentions of shaking things up.
I was going to put my head down and do my research, publish my articles in
traditional journal venues, create a traditional article-based dissertation,
and finish in the allotted four years. Six years later, and I accomplished,
well... none of the above. Along the way I got a look behind the curtain
of academic publishing. I didn't like what I saw. Not even a little bit.
This was fueled by an introduction to Open Science. Science in the context of
Open Science just made sense to me. This caused some delays as I dived into an
Open Science rabbit hole. Also, covid.
At first I vowed (to myself and those around me who would listen) never
to publish any of my papers in Evilseer. Then, I took it a step further
and vowed the same for more major publishers, including Springer and
Wiley. Why do we pay publishers to take our copyright, publish our research,
then pay extra so we are allowed read it? You may not be paying out of pocket,
but your library is likely covering those costs with expensive subscriptions.
I'm sure they would much rather use that money on more useful stuff. All this to
say, you won't find any of my PhD papers in the traditional journals.
I wanted to try different platforms, like preprint servers and PCI_Archaeology.

Around the beginning of my of PhD research I was also introduced to
R statistical software. I can no longer remember how this came about,
but after many months of rage-quitting
and returning to SPSS, vowing never to open R again, I started to
see the value of using scripting languages (and free, non-proprietary software)
for statistical analysis.
It turns out when something is reproducible, it's easy to reproduce...
No need for the same 'point and click' all over again. I used R Markdown for most
of my output, website, presentations, articles, etc. Then I took it a step further
and started writing my dissertation in R Markdown. My dissertation was now fully
reproducible, and could be output to different formats with little change to
the documents with the actual content. One of these formats was HTML.
I could turn my dissertation into a website. That was pretty cool. I could
have a dynamic, outward-facing dissertation easily modified when needed.
This series of events led me to publishing my dissertation online,
before it was completed, as
a way to show the progress to the world. Of course most of the world
didn't actually care, but a few people thought it was a cool idea, and,
more importantly, it made the writing part enjoyable. Well maybe
not quite enjoyable, but certainly less unpleasant. It also motivated
me to make continuous progress. Eventually I converted to Quarto (basically R
Markdown on steroids). It allowed me to continue using
R for all of my analyses, and conveniently output them to the necessary formats,
with extra features for the HTML version, including summary paragraphs which
became the TL;DR.
It also feels less 'janky' than my previous implementation in R Markdown (but still
not jank-free).
The wide availability of my dissertation meant I started making accessibility a
focus. This means increasing the readability and
legibility of the dissertation, not only with the formatting, but with the
language used. This doesn't necessarily mean that it can be easily picked
up by someone with limited knowledge of the field. Writing 'academically' is
not just exclusionary to members of the public, but also to those for whom
English does not come naturally. Plus, I've found it to be a tedious read, even
as a native English speaker. In my experience, writing more accessibly also
requires a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Open Science is a priority in all of my work and will be reflected in this
dissertation; sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. Admittedly this is
occasionally taken to an extreme: A fully reproducible dissertation, publishing
everything before it's actually done, and avoiding traditional journals. Ultimately
I was just fed up with the status quo. We as researchers need to do better.
We need to ask ourselves why we are doing science, and for whom we are doing it.
