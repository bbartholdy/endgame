# Hello {-}

This is a PhD dissertation written with the **bookdown** package [@bookdown]. A PDF version of the dissertation, which
includes a variety of trivial formalities, will be released when it's done. In the meantime
you can follow the progress of my dissertation on this site.

**Note: This is a continuously updated draft of my dissertation (until further notice). It has yet to be reviewed by a committee.**
