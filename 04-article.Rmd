We used the BYOC model to try and look at how starch granules are incorporated
into dental calculus. We 'fed' the biofilm with a known quantity of starch granules
during the growth period. Preliminary results suggest that a very small proportion
of consumed starch is retained by the calculus. The size of starch granules also
influences the likelihood of retention.
